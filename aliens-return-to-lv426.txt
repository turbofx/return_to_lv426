Chapter 1.


"Wake up pretty boy!" laughs a marine with a gentle slap to my face.

The cold air hits my bare legs like a wall. This is always the worst
part of waking out of hyper sleep.

Tugs and pulls rouse me out of my ethereal slumber as various needles,
probes and sensors are pulled out.

I crack my eyes to blazing light.

"Jesus, could you turn the lights up even more?" I grunt back.

"Oh, now you're awake." laughs a voice. I know that voice. My brain is
starting to come back online. Corpsman something or other, it'll come
to me.

Dickenson is the corpsman. As they go, at least not a total asshole to
me. "Chow in twenty. Muster in an hour." replies Dickenson. Apparently
she's looked me over and decided to move on.

As my vision adjusts, I lift my head to a satisfying crack as my spine
decides it wants to stretch. I look down the line of hyper sleep
chambers. This half open, the other half closed. I mentally count,
even. No hyper sleep casualties.

The USN DeBrasco is the third ship of the modular gladiator class of
star ships and has the latest generation of everything, including the
next generation hyper sleep modules. I stagger over to my locker, my
muscles protesting with every step.

The black BDU is yet another way I'm a bit different from your standard
Colonial Space marine. The collar manages to perfectly rub against my
neck right were my neural shunt and the skin meet. I'm convinced the BDU
designers designed it this way. Yet another annoyance my brain registers.

"Waking up is always the worst" mumbles a voice next to me. I look
over and see Janice. A fellow cyber tech. The clothes are even more ill
fitting on her. Her petite size in stark contrast to everything designed
for large muscle bound marines. I notice she's donned a scarf around
her neck to deal with the collar chaffing issue.

Janice and I have a complicated thing going. She comes over and gives
me a hug. I hug back. Ah, no kiss, still complicated.

We wander down the line of lockers collecting the other four members of
our rag tag cyber tech gang. All to gether we head into the chow hall.

The chow hall of this ship is the usual. Polished metal, food you'd rather
not eat, created out of who knows what and the usual derisive sneers,
outright jeers and the occasional head shake. As usual, the marines have
left a table just for us. We get in line with the everybody else.

"Why the fuck did they send six of you?" I hear from behind me with
a poke.

I turn and looking down at me is a marine easily a foot taller and about
twice as wide.

"Fuck if I know. Why did they send so many marines?" I ask back.

At this the marines snickers, "Fuck if I know" he laughs back.

The eggs are in a cube, the bacon is fake, something is clearly wrong with
the food printer, my bread has actual layer shift lines. I shake my head,
despite all the improvements in star ships and hyper sleep chambers,
apparently the auto cook was low on their priorities.

I take my place in the center of the table, a spot left for me by
Janice. "Five to One" Marco mumbles. "They send thirty marines and six
cyber techs."

"More than that." replies Janice. "They only opened half the pods. It's
ten to one."

"Not quite. I looked at the roster, there's a bunch of scientists with us
as well. But Marco is right the did bring quite a few marines." I reply.

"Why so many?" Marco asks. He's asking me because I'm technically
considered the senior officer. Technically because the Space Marines
in their disdain basically excluded the cybernetics techs out of their
usual command chain. Cybernetics technician first class is all the rank
I'll ever get, unless I want to head off to "real" boot camp.

The fact we get to even call ourselves marines pisses off the regular
marines. All the rigger, all the physical training, all the crawling in
mud, zero g combat stuff they do, we don't. Instead it's lots of invasive
surgery for neural shunts, brain augmentation devices and lots and lots
of studying.

"Are they planning on going down?" asks Ruvi, yet another long standing
member of our cyber tech squad. All these questions I don't have answers
to. "I know only a tiny bit more than you guys do. I got roughly the
same orders you got, showed up to the same packaging facility and found
myself here." They know I know more, but realizing that I'm not going
to divulge more details in present company, everybody gets back to the
business of eating their slop. The other three members of the squad
having asked no questions were still in the shell shock phase of this
whole thing. I pat Jeremy on the shoulder. "How you handling your first
trip as a cyber so far?" I ask. "Better than I thought. Damn neural shunt
is itching like hell though." I get up and look at his neck. It's red as
hell. He was the only member of our team who was a former Colonial Marine,
in some ways it pisses the other marines off even more. "After muster,
go find Dickinson and have her look at that."  He simply nods. I know
hey won't. He'll suffer in silence.


Chapter 2.


We line up on our spot on the muster line.

The marines line up ramrod straight.

"Company at attention!" yells a sergeant.

"Attend hut!" the marines yell back, echoing through the cavernous
chamber. Our group manages to bellow out an "Attend hut" with the rest
of them. The sergeant walks the line. Stopping at Janice.

"Is that scarf regulation Ms. Allman?" snaps the sergeant.

"No sir." she replies.

"Loose it!" he replies, shaking his head and moving down the line.

At this a couple of marines snort.

A loose button, a couple BDU's not cuffed properly. He's a real stickler
for detail. "Ready Room one, on the double!" yells the sergeant. Now happy
that in the case of sudden depressurization of the hull or fire, at least
the forty odd people's corpses will look good or something like that.

Being last in line, the room had exactly thirty seats. We all know
our spot on the line and the number of seats is without accident. We
dutifully stand in the back. The usual mild hazing, the norm.

Seeing this, the sergeant snaps, "Get our techs some seats!"

At this a marine out loud jokes, "Why, all they do is sit anyway?"

"Stow it Wikowsky and now you're getting them seats!" the sergeant
barks back.

From a recess on the wall, additional flat pack desk chairs are unpacked
and handed out. Satisfied everybody is now seated, the CO strides in
and the sermon begins.

A wall screen starts up showing a planet of swirl of muddled oranges,
browns and whites. Below it are bold letters that read "LV426". Head
nods and fist bumps ripple through the Marines.

"Welcome back to the shit hole known as LV426. Also know as Acheron,
Hadley's Hope and a few other wilder names. As I know you've all read the
operation briefing, this is also the first planet where we encountered the
what is now know as the Xenomorph." A murmur moves through the room. A
couple marines shake their fists, a xenomorph head is tattooed on the
back of their hands.

"Our job here is to recon the planet to evaluate it for habitability and
additional threats. Even though the primary atmospheric processor that
was installed near the settlement was destroyed, the four additional
atmospheric processors have continued to function. Wayland has spend
big money on this planet and they've hired our outfit to ensure that
the previous tenants have left."

So, this is a corporate gig, it makes sense. Why abandon a perfectly
serviceable planet just because it had had a few pesky inhabitants?

At this a marines hand shot up, "Yes Corporal?"

"What if we find more hostiles?" the corporal asked.

"Recon first, hostile elimination if needed." replies the CO.

I knew this was coming. I'd been given a prior briefing explaining some
of the mission parameters.

The moment we came out of hyperspace, we began mapping the surface.

The screen changes to show the planet without the clouds.

A quick zoom in shows the crater where the primary atmospheric processor
and the settlement had been.

The other atmospheric processors are highlighted on the map.

As well as a red zone. "This is the location of the derelict alien
ship. It is known to contain xenomorph eggs. It is considered a no-go
zone. Our objectives are the processors. In particular processors two
and three that has gone off the grid."

The screen turns off.

"Cyber will be landing Rockies first, then if deemed needed,
marines." Hands slapped desks, general groans, more than a couple marines
looked back and gave us looks I'm sure their grandmothers would have
disapproved of.

Since the original events on LV426, the Xenomorph had become a cultural
boogie man for the Colonial Marines. More than a few marines in this group
sport Xenomorph tattoos and talk righteously of avenging their fallen
brothers. Here they are, at the place it had first gone down and the
prospect of unleashing hell on their enemies was being snatched from them.

Jeremy had told me that a big part of their training now consisted of
simulated combat with xenomorphs. Guys build tiny shrines depicting
their eventual victories over this foe. Xenomorph heads as trophies
are a popular thing to come out of the various printers. I wasn't
unsympathetic to their feelings or cause. Though to me, going nose to
nose with a predator that could at best kill me or at worst use me as a
womb for another xenomorph doesn't sound appealing at all. As far as I
am concerned, I'm more than happy to merely orbit the planet. Landing in
ankle deep mud and fighting monsters is a job for robots and these guys.

However, the events on LV426 had lead to me being here. After the
debacle, the military realized that threats like the xenomorphs weren't
going to be easily tackled by men and women in body armor. Two major
innovations happened that changed things in a big way. The first was
the subspace radio. This allowed for far faster comms across stellar
distances. Moreover, it took remote control and sensing to the next
level. The second innovation was the creation of neural shunt technology
that allows for the true blending of man and machine. Suddenly the
military was presented with the reality of having robots they could
control at great distances. You might be asking why even come on this
ship then? As the Astro techs have tried to explain some of the math, the
farther you are away, the lower the amount of bandwidth. Communicating
with Earth is now so slow it can be measured in bits per minute. As
this session dragged on and various training and maintenance tasks were
handed out a few marines groused more and more about not getting down to
the planet, I wondered why they'd even been thawed. A thought a couple
marines had expressed as well. Others took it in stride. Fine if they
weren't going to get down to the planet, they were going to be riding
our asses and looking at every pixel we fed back.

This whole thing was going to be hot garbage anyway you cut it.

Robinson strides out the ready room, ramrod straight with his admin
in tow.

"Deployment will be at 0700 tomorrow. Cybers prep for
drop. Dismissed!" barked the Sargent.

Walking back to "Candy land" as everybody called our module the grumbles
in the halls get louder.

Wikowsky pushes his way up to our group, stabbing a finger in my chest,
"All this bullshit so you weenies can shuffle around in your tin cans?"

I've been to this rodeo plenty of times. The trick was to show the guy
think you're in the same boat as him and then give him a carrot. "Look
man, I'm just following orders like the rest of you. If we find something,
you'll see it as well. The feeds will be going to everybody."

"The Mark I eyeball is all I need." he replied which brought a couple
"yeas" from the group that formed around us. I could sense the tension
in the area, this guy had a xenomorph tattoo on his forearm. "We have
chain of command for a reason. Talk to your CO, I've got orders."

Jeremy's hand catches Wikowsky's fist millimeters from my face, he then
spins into a jujitsu move that has Wikowsky pinned to the wall. Nose to
nose, Jeremy growls, "Stow it. We've got enough going on without your
bullshit as well." At this, Jeremy drops the lock and gave the guy a
good shove. We turn and walk away. "Keep walking" he yells.

After a couple more paces he finishes with "He's a traitor to the Corps
and you're not even fucking marines. Why they let you chicken shits on
this mission I'll never know."

Sadly, this isn't the first time I've dealt with this. I simply point
to the corner and say, "Tsk tsk, Cameras."

Realizing that like every part of the ship, this is being recorded,
he finally gets the hint, turns heel and stomps off.

"What a fucking hot head" quips Janice.

"Seriously. How did he get through the damn pysch eval?" jokes
Marco. Jeremy snickers, "You have no idea how low the standards truly
are."

Chapter 3.


0700 gives us nearly ten hours to do final load out on our rockies. The
real name is some word salad remotely operational cyber kenetic enabled
recon systems or some shit. Everybody just called them rockies in an
homage to the old film about a boxer and the rock'em sockem robots game
that someone had dutifully printed out and had affixed to the wall of the
prep room.

The other funnier name that went around was "killer mushrooms" due to
the large sensor dome that afforded the operator a 360 degree view of
their surroundings. On four articulated legs and with two powerful and
two smaller manipulator arms, they could damn near climb anything, cut
through anything and come home to talk about it. Covered in high tech
ceramic armor and hard points they could take a beating and also bring
a substantial amount of firepower to a situation as well.

For this mission we'd also been issued "sleds." Drop vehicles
that contain their own power supplies and can carry a rocky great
distances as well as carry spares and additional ammo. Cradled in
their storage units, we looked at the load out manifests. "What the
fuck is this?" quips Jeremy.  I came over to look at his tablet. "Glue
dispensers?" pointing to the tablet. I took a deep breath, time for the
rest of the briefing. "Everybody take a seat." I said. "The marines got
told what they needed, we have secondary orders to capture a xenomorph
if possible. Hence the aforementioned glue dispensers."

"And then do what? Bring it on this ship? No fucking way." replies Janice.
"According to the brass they've got some magic resin to encased and
rendered them inert." I explained. "Jesus have mercy on us." mumbles Mike.
The last member of our group was a petite woman named Joanne, but went
by the handle Roxxie. "Roxxie, I've been quiet through all this. Feel
free to speak up." At this, she let out a sigh. "A missions a mission,
but this seems like a really bad one. I've read the files on what those
things are capable of. Acid for blood, super strong, immune to vacuum. Has
one even been captured to test this containment on?" We all know the
answer to that. Even one had been, we'd have been the last to be told
about it. "I know saying trust the system is clique here, but in this
case, we're going to have to roll with it." Everybody nods. We all know
the score. There were bigger things afoot here, we just weren't entirely
privy to all the details. "Look on the bright side, we've got latitude
on our load outs. Pack for a party!" Like kids in a candy store, they go
to work. Ammo drums are hosted into place, bolts tightened, connectors
checked. Over the next three hours drop details are fed to my tablet. Ruvi
pings me. "Do we even know the drop point?" he asks. In response,
I forward the entire intel packet to everybody on the team. "Sir, you
just gave me everything." replies Ruvi. "Yes. I've got that power and
I'm using it. Let's not go in with eyes half open. Two teams. Team 1 is
Myself, Marco and Janice. Team two is Ruvi, Roxxie and Jeremy."

I wanted to make sure there was someone senior on each team. Roxxie had
a cool head and was a solid respected leader in the group. More data
flows in. My team is going to investigate why atmospheric processor two
isn't calling home. Team two is going to investigate the third processor
plant. Everybody nods happy with this arrangement. "Let's get some rest,
0500 I expect everybody ready to enter their cradles and jack in."

Chapter 4.


Dinner is somewhat nicer than our wake up meal. Apparently a tech
somewhere had tinkered with the auto cook because I get something that
resembles an actual hamburger. Not ones to complain, we eat our soy
protein burgers, head back and hit the sack. We get the usual side eye
and head shakes but we're left unmolested otherwise.

Four thirty is damn early, anyway you cut it. The marines make you used
to it, but it's still rough. I get up, bang on doors and got sundry
mumbles. Roxxie and Ruvi appear to be rooming together, honestly, I not
surprised and I'm happy for them.

Janice strides out of her quarters, haptic suit on and ready to roll. The
two of us exchange knowing glances and Janice glances at Roxxie's door
and simply raises her eyebrows. I shrug back. Frankly, I was hoping for
a late night knock that didn't come.

As Janice and I are warming up our cradles, the other members stroll
in, hot coffee in hand and climb down into their cradles and start
the warm up procedures. For cybernetics technicians, jacking in has a
number of serious dangers. The most common to newer users is known as
transition shock. Your brain is quite happy with all the usual sensory
input and then you pull the rug out and give it different and additional
inputs. Our group at this point has been jacking in at the low end for
two years and at the high end like myself for nearly a decade. I slide
my head back into the cradle and feel the click of the interface to my
neural shunt. My head is now locked in place, the visor slides down
and I feel the various cinch points as the haptic suit pins me down.
"Initiate transition" I say. Immediately I'm dropped into darkness.
"Commander, unit number one is ready." I say "Thank you Alice" but
my lips don't move. I'm fully shunted in. Alice is the AI for our
group. We're encouraged to give them names and interact with them as
full team members.  There's so much data flowing in, without an AI
to help collate it, you'd quickly be overwhelmed. "Status check" I
say into the comms channel.  "Team 1 ready, team 2 ready." I get firm
replies. Good, everybody has jacked in without issue. I switch over to
the command channel.  "Cybertech teams  one and two ready." I say into
the channel.  "Roger that. Hold tight, we are adjusting our orbit for
optimal insertion."  a voice says back. Into the channel I've designated
"Team 1".  The operational CO speaks up. "Team 1, prepare for drop in
thirty seconds.  Team 2, drop in 45 seconds."

This part is a bit of a nothing burger for us. The sleds and our
rockies will either make it to the ground in one piece or they simply
drop another unit. We have six units, plus an additional six ready
to go and just as many in spares  that can be assembled. During this
time we access the various optical systems on the nadar side of the
ship. Janice pings me. "Glad we've got subspace on the rockys, it looks
like one hell of storm in the north."  I change my perspective and she
is right. While always harsh, the detonation of the primary processor
had thrown gigatons of dust into the atmosphere, helping to trap more
heat and ironically speeding up the terraforming process.  A wet and
rainy planet now with extra heat pumped into it, meant big storms.
"I wonder if the issue with unit three is water intrusion or a bolt of
lightning?"  remarked Marco into our group channel. Privately I hoped,
though these stations were built to be dropped from orbit and "just work."

Bingo, five by five, confirmation of soft landing. The petals of the
drop capsule unfold. The sleds treads lock down. All green. Already the
sensors on my rocky were registering a gust of 50km/h.

Alice shifts through the spectrum's, nothing. Without needing any urging
we proceeded towards the processing plant. Fuck. The blast doors are
ajar, at least a half meter. "I was really hoping to find nobody home."
Janice whispered into the chat. "Me too." I whisper back.

I notice that Alice had already brought all the weapons online.  Alice and
I had been paired more than five years ago, it had gotten some intuition
about it and I appreciated it. "No damage to the doors" Alice notes. Maybe
just a mechanical screw up? Marco creeps forward, deploying his smaller
set of dexterous hands he manipulates the controls. The door grinds open
a couple more centimeters. "That's all I'm going to get, the mechanism
is seized or jammed, I can't tell from here." Not surprising, water
likely got into the track.

I move forward and look closer. I unlimbered my big arms. I attempted to
pry the doors, but they only start to deform. Time to ask to break stuff.
"Permission to cut into the blast doors?" I ask. "Granted. Breach the
doors and enter."  the CO orders.

My plasma torch makes quick work of the blast doors. Plates of durasteel
fall to the mud with a sizzle. All three of us stalk through the steaming
opening into the lower entry bay of atmospheric processor number 3.

"Fuck me." whispers Marco. Behind me I can see that the door mechanism is
gummed up with Alien excretion. Every wall surface and the ceiling are
caked with it. Frozen into the walls are various shapes, their chests
burst open, but so coated in excretion and decayed as to make them
unrecognizable. "Confirm hostiles" I said into the channel.
"Roger that. Team two confirms evidence of hostiles as well." comes through
on the command channel. "I don't understand, there's nothing on this
rock for them to eat or use as wombs?" Marco gestures at the wall.
"Eh, please don't say womb." replies Janice. I can feel her disgust in the
channel. The dangers of being jacked in, bits of emotion travel across
the link. "Sorry." replies Marco. "Get samples" comes through the
channel. "Roger." I bark back. A compartment in the front of my rocky
opens, I dutifully scrap some of the alien excretions into the container,
It snaps shut. I can tell the fusion reactor is online, the vibration
is enough I can feel it through the haptic suit.

"Deploy recon drones" I order. Triangular drones lift off from the top
of each of our sensor stacks. "Marco, Up, Janice down, I'll take straight
ahead." I call out. This is for the benefit of the marines I know are
watching the feed. Alice controls the drones as they fly through the
facility. Doppler pulses, wide band IR and optical scanners feed
information back to Alice and into my mind mapping out the facility
and comparing it to schematics. I locate the nearest network interface
and patch in. The fusion reactor is functioning but at lowered power.
Its heat exchangers have been compromised. This smells exactly like
the reports from the other facility.

"Contact." Janice announces into the channel. "Lower level, My drone
was swatted out of the air. I have four distinct entities moving."
"Xenomorphs?" I ask. "It happened fast sir, the drone was nailed
from above." A quick reply shows the drone be swatted by the dark, vaguely
biomechancial hand of a xeno. "Deploy another?" she asks. "Save them. They
know we're here. I bring the camera feeds up. Dozens of cameras and only
7 were operational? The operational ones have been encased, their feeds
useless. It seems the Xenomorphs intentionally covered them or destroyed
them, but why would they know or care? Yet another question to file
away. My drone returns. Nobody home on the ground level.

"Movement, upper level, and lower." Marco was right. I heard the tromping
of feet on steel treads from above. These remote processors weren't that
elaborate. Three levels, Just a fusion reactor, large vents to draw in
air, machinery to split out the bad stuff, add in the good stuff and
shoot the atmosphere out. No control room, just a single console, spare
parts storage and miles of pipe and cables.

A dozen drones spilled out of the stairway. Some were full size drones
we'd all seen in the archive footage, others were slightly smaller,
thinner, pale xenos with weirdly curved heads. Training fully kicks in,
I tracked and fired a three round burst through the closest drone.
Configured to burst in the chest cavity, the first drone blows in half
throwing green acidic blood and guts in every direction. Immediately
a stripe of optics goes out, Automatically the sensor rotates to put
the dark spot at the back. Janice nails one of the pale smaller
xenomorphs with the glue canister.  A thick mesh of adhesive has
entangled the creature. Identical to it's larger cousin, it struggles
and snarls as the glue sets. "Not sure how it would work against a big
one, but we bagged ourselves a mini." Marco our resident nerd about
all things xenomorph chimes in, "None of the intel I've ever seen has
shown one this small, or skinny." Small is relative. This creature is
still near two meters tall, just very thin and pale, with an oddly
shaped head. Drones keep stalking forward now unsure what to do with
these new foes. I order our team to back out of the processor. Acid
eating through some critical part of the cooling system of the fusion
reactor is definitely a "bad thing." I'm also keenly aware a 10mm
caseless HE round in the wrong spot will quickly end this mission.
The drones surge through the gap we'd cut in the door, only to be
shredded three strides out. The assault ends quickly. Alice has kept
a running count, eleven in total. Janice creeps back inside and
retrieves our prize. Marco is busy sampling the various fluids
leaking from the drones. "This ain't good" I hear over the channel.
"I've got a jar made out of their super material, it held the xeno
blood for about five minutes." Looking over I see him holding up the
jar, the bottom of it gone.

"Team one, return to dust off point with the specimen." At this Janice
opens a Private channel. "This is bullshit. Marco just showed them that
their magic test jar couldn't stop their blood. Do you want to be on
the DeBe with that thing?" The honest answer was no.
"Command, this is Team 1 leader. Reporting that Marco's containment
vessel failed. Requesting sit eval on return of specimen to
DeBraso?"

"We are aware of the situation" came the reply. It was easy
to forget that all our video is being distributed across the ship into
various war rooms. Minutes go by as we wait. Privately in our channel
we muse about conversations being had on the bridge.

"Orders are as follows. Restrain specimen to Marco's sled. Investigate
transmitted grid location." Marco immediately goes to his sled and
unloads additional ammo canisters and a spare portable reactor.
Janice pipes up in our side channel, "What the fuck is the plan?"
"Dunno. Follow orders, go to the grid location." I said flatly.
We secure the Xeno to Marco's sled as it hisses and snaps at us.
As soon as the last tie down is cinched, it promptly trundles off
over the horizon. We stowed ourselves and the supplies onto the
remaining sleds. "That little one was weird, what was up with its head?"
asks Marco. Both Janice and I say nothing. This whole thing is weird
and getting weirder. The sleds grind through the mud leaving deep
furrows as they chug towards our next objective.
"Alice, please eject me." I said to the AI. Immediately my senses
reverted back to the usual's. I hit the eject button and the visor slides
back and I felt the neural shunt disengage. Janice and Marco stepped
up out of the pits as well. "Estimated travel time for the sleds is
two hours." I say. They nod. There were long term effects of the
neural shunts. Headaches being the most prominent one. I could feel
one brewing and in more than one way. I jogged slowly down one of
the central hab spars that ran the length of the ship. To get the
blood flowing and to get some answers. Soon I find myself at the
Combat Information Center (CIC) door. "Permission to Enter?"
I asked at the intercom. The door slid open. "Permission
granted." I got gruffly back. On the walls I could see the six views
from the rocky's as they roll over the terrain. A tech turns and
says over her shoulder, "Team three drop ship is nominal. ETA nine
minutes."

Wait what, I reeled a bit. Another team? We are the only cybers
on the ship? That can only mean one thing. Commander Robinson clears
his throat, "As you are well aware PFC Hurgs, we are the middle of a
mission. Other than stretching your legs, why are you in my CIC?"
"Sir, I'm concerned about the failure of Marco's test vessel."
At this he simply shakes his head. "Son, you are well above your
pay grade here. That's not the only vessel we brought with us. We've
got the situation handled. Get back in your pit and get back to
the mission." I was then tossed out of the CIC.

This whole thing stinks. I deeply dislike being used as a cog in
a machine I didn't know what direction is traveling. I walk back
to candy land and it hits me. Dr. Jaggo. I climbed back into the pit,
but I didn't jack in. Instead I write up a quick note to one of the techs
back on Earth. IF anybody had been involved in the creation of the storage
vessels, it is Dr. Jaggo. Normally our paths wouldn't have crossed except
for that she'd been pulled into a project to outfit the rocky's with
composite armor to make the more resistant to the creatures wildly acidic
blood. She is the expert when it comes to the xenos blood. The message sat
in the send queue. Weird. I checked the logs. Subspace link offline? Yet
another weird thing. Janice and Marco were already jacked back in, I
follow suit.

What a rainy nasty planet. The storm we'd seen from orbit had spun off
a series of smaller storms and we are enjoying the benefits of one
of them. Winds lash the sleds. We tumbled through the various bands
looking for anything alive. Around us the ground is glowing with lichen
mats, the puddles teem with microbial life. "Weird wildlife" Marco
said into the channel to no one in particular.
"I don't understand how there were drones. There's supposed to be no
large life forms on this planet." replies Janice. It's true. This was
something that had bothered us and had become hotly debated while our
robots traversed the plant.  The xeno life cycle was well known.
"What was encased on the walls then?" I ask.
To that there's simply silence in the channel. We turn our attention
to the planet. The landscape is windswept and desolate. The planet is
beautiful in a primordial way. I can see how eventually with decades
of terraforming it will eventually be nice. Get some gmo grasses going,
calm down the atmosphere. I let the sensor data wash over me as muse
about this. This place could be a paradise one day, but that was far
in the future. It was Marco who saw it first. "What the fuck is that?"
he said into the channel.

I snapped out of my daydream about the planet and realized he was talking
about the Xenos. Marco's rocky springs from the sled and lands agile
like a cat. "Is that a pig?" asked Janice. Alice answers into the chat,
"Based on image analysis, yes." The three rocky's scan around this
pigs corpse. It's chest blown open in classic xenomorph form. "It's not
decayed much if not at all." I notice. "CIC, you seeing this?" I said
into the command channel. Over the channel I heard commander Robinson's
exhale. "We see it. This might change the number of hostiles." In our
private channel Marco muttered, "ya think!" Marco climbs back aboard
and we trundle on, however now all three of us fully extended our sensor
bulbs. Without prompting Marco launches an additional drones to provide a
larger swath of over watch, yet again showing initiative.


Chapter 5.


"What an ugly hole in the ground." says Marco. Both Janice and I
acknowledge it in the channel, it was. Three meters high and seven
meters wide it went down at a steep angle. "Permission to launch a
drone into Hadley's asshole?" asks Marco. We both snicker, I hear
someone on the command channel snicker as well. "Any idea what might
be down there?" I ask. "Shit loads of drones, who knows what else. I'm
still boggling about that skinny pale one" Janice quips. "Permission
granted. We came to get intel, launch a drone." I order. You have give the
to xenos credit, they're at least consistent. Their architecture if
you could call it that, is very bio mechanical. Down the center of the ceiling
a long spine protrudes, ribs a meter deep extend off this spine down the walls
to the floor. Weird spiny crenelations protrude from the walls all over the place.
Deep alcoves and blind corners fill this cave. The entrance descends fifty
meters and then opens into a low cavern, the air is so humid the down wash
from the drone is easily visible. Tunnels go off in eight different
directions. "I bet it stinks" Marco says.
"Can it. I'm liking this less and less." I say. "Pick a tunnel."

Marco flies the drone down the third tunnel. Seventy five meters
and another twenty meters deeper into the tunnel system we found our
first breeding room. "Oh shit." was all Marco says. "Oh god." Janice
whispers. Humans, or what was left of them pinned to walls. Some dead,
some alive their abdomens swollen. "How?" whispered Janice. "Free
booters." Marco says flatly into the channel. Wayland could try to kill it
whenever it came out on the nets, but the knowledge was out there. You
can't build five building size atmo processors, modular buildings,
train and recruit families and launch them without people talking. The
people who got left behind told stories of a paradise, of clean land and
water, blue skies. People want off the increasingly crowded polluted
Earth. There are stories of groups going off and landing on charted
planets without a charter and claiming them, I'd never seen proof,
until now. "Pull the drone out, pick another tunnel." I say flatly.
"We're just going to leave them?" snarls Janice. I felt her disgust.
I didn't like it either. "I promise we'll make sure they don't suffer."
I said into the channel.

The next tunnel we found another birthing chamber, but we find pigs
instead. It makes sense. Pigs, humans, dogs, livestock, the xenos didn't
really give a shit. The four chamber is weirder though. Pig pens. Dozens of them.
Sows squealed at the drone. The sows had been glued down by the alien resin.
Something that looked like an adapted facehugger grips each sows head.
I could feel both Marco's and Janice's disgust through the neural link.
"They're breeding fucking pigs?" someone says into the various additional
channels that had linked into the common channel. "They're stupid animals,
how could they be breeding pigs?" some unnamed marine asks in the channel.
I let out a breath. "Easy. They've been watching us." I say. At this, all the
channels go quiet. "We can't just leave those people." says Janice. She
is right. Marco has been busy going down additional tunnels. In the
sixth tunnel we found something weird, a pulsing mass from ceiling to
floor, the weird pale xenos crawling all over it.
"What the fuck is that?!?" Marco says into the channel. "Permission to
engage?" asks Janice. "Permission granted." I said. Janice unlimbers her
rocky, but the drone had done it's work. Finally the doorman had noticed
someone knocking around in the lobby and had raised the alarm. The response
was staggering. Dozens of drones spill out of tunnels letting out ethereal
screams.

Marco's drone gets knocked out of the air, swatted effectively by a long
xeno hand. They seem pretty good at it actually. This was going to get
out of hand quick. "Destroy the entrance!" I order. Alice loads and fires a
trio of forty millimeter grenades at the roof of the tunnel. Large divots
are knocked from roof but it holds. Janice's rocky rips into the roof with
grenades and gun fire. "Damn, that's tough shit!" I growl and more grenades
rain into Hadley's asshole. Finally the roof gives out and bows more than
collapses, the entrance now resembles a pinched tube, drones squirm out
only to be cut down by a fusillade of gunfire. The pile of shattered xeno's
grow. "Prepare for dust off in thirty seconds." a voice from the CIC
comes through the command channel. The sleds extend up hard points. A heavy
lift carry all latches on lifting away our sleds.  Marco launch's a parting
trio of grenades into the left opening of the collapsed tunnel. The shock wave
blows xeno guts and body parts out the other side.
"Eat shit motherfuckers!" laughed Marco. In the channel we heard a hardy
"Yeah!"
"Standby for shock wave." the same person from the CIC calls out. We watch
the feeds as a shock wave emanates out from the site. I ping Janice on the
private channel. "I promised they wouldn't suffer." The DeBe launches another
rail gun round into the site. Another shock wave ripples out. Accessing the
optics on the DeBe, a large depression has formed in that spot. We've
pulverized the whole site from orbit.


Chapter 6.


The briefing room is crowded. Any pretense about sitting or desks
has faded away. The marines simply nodded at us and let us move to the
front. Apparently we'd shown some metal down there. Commander Robinson
is standing at the wall screen, "As it stands now, we have an unknown
number of civvies on the planet to account for." A marine speaks up, "Sir,
they don't have a charter, we're not obligated." The commander shakes his
head. "Obligated no, but our mission is to secure this planet. We've got
evidence of xeno activity and of them doing weird shit down there. Teams
one and two splatted no less than sixty of the damn things and bagged
a live one." A tech walks to the front of the room. "Knowing we have
free booters on the planet, we changed the parameters of our surface
scans looking for anomalies." The screen changes to a view of the southern
hemisphere. "In this case, ground penetrating radar seems to be unable
to penetrate this small area. The map zooms in and an area of irregular
triangles highlighted. "Stealth mats?" I asked out loud. "We think so. The
computer had to wash the image a bunch of times. They did a really good
job breaking up regular shapes. We only found it because we had to
change the computers filters." "Any chance you nerds could find more
of those nests?" asked a Marine. "Yes in fact." with that the screen
changes to show dozens of similar openings on the surface. Thermogroraphy
showed the classic eight legged tunnel system. "Facehugger?" someone
asks. It did, the thermals made it look like a facehugger. The tech
speaks up, "Sir, that puts an entrance within five clicks of Team
three."
"Have they been made aware?" asked the commander.
"Yes. They've deployed sentries, they've contained the specimen and
will be blasting off within the hour." Contained the specimen. That
sounded like they were going to be bringing the damn thing on board.
"Permission to speak freely?" I asked. "Granted." replied the commander.
I took a deep breath, "We've just witnessed that the xenos' are smarter
than we thought. We should abandon our assumptions about them. Fine,
you want to dissect that one, I'm more than willing to task my rocky
to a science tech, on the surface, but not onboard." Other marines nod
their heads in agreement. The commander nods his head, "Once again your
concerns have been noted." "Cyber teams one and two are to be on standby
prep until further notice, dismissed." While I knew this was somewhat of a
punishment for speaking up, I was glad we were going to be just chilling
in the pit ready to drop in a moments notice. Our cradles were also far
better and accessing and consuming the petabytes of data that were flowing
through the systems. Team two had been as lucky as we had been. Their
processing station was also filled with drones, including the small pale
ones. The glue had been ineffective at stopping regular drones and it had
turned into a turkey shoot. Roxxie's rocky had been damaged by drones,
but still functional. Roxxie and Ruvi were in the prep area working on
her rocky. Janice and Marco were looking at the drone footage. I peeked
in and they were looking at the footage of the weird column. I checked
the message queue, still pending. "Alice, what's the current state of
our subspace transmitters?" "All Cyber command subspace transmitters are
online." it replies. Alice is fire walled into our systems. It doesn't know
much more than we do. Edgar is the AI that runs the ship. Unlike Alice,
it generally lacks personality. More of a glorified central operator,
all the ships data flows through it. I connected to Edgar.
Query: Status of subspace transmission link with Earth?
Result: Link currently offline due to hardware malfunction.
Query: Estimate of time to repair?
Result: Unknown hardware fault, time to repair unknown.
So we're cut off
from Earth.
Query: Current mission parameters? Result:
       1. Assess habitability of LV426.
       2. Capture and analyze any lifeforms found.
       3. Eliminate any hostile lifeforms.
I knew better than to assume there were just three mission parameters.
This was a military AI and therefore very cagey. It was telling me
the mission parameters I was authorized to see.

Query: How much food are we currently carrying?
Result: Based on current crew size, 645 days of regular rations.
We have literally tons of food on board. They expected us to possibly out here for
a long time.

Query: What is our current compliment of scientists on board.
Result: 14 scientific specialists are on board.
Query: How many are currently out of hyper sleep.
Result: 14.

Okay, so we have nearly as many scientists as we have soldiers,
not counting the the additional squads we had on ice and they're all awake.
As a Cybertech, I was trained on a number of systems, including the maintenance
of subspace radios. I decided to take a different tact.

Query: Nature of the hardware malfunction of subspace radio.
Result: Unable to communicate with communications module.
Query: Do I have clearance to inspect the hardware?

I knew based on the pause I knew someone in the CIC was likely having
a "WTF?" moment as the ships AI asked them if some cyber tech could go
fishing around in the comms space. At this my ear buzzed.
"Cybertech first class Hurgs. Why is Edgar asking us if it's okay if you
go poking around in the comms room?" came a voice I didn't recognize over
the comm link. "Sir, I'm a qualified subspace tech, I noticed our link
to Earth is offline." I replied. "We've got people working on it, if we
need help, we'll let you know. Request denied." the voice replied and
disconnected. I'm really making friends on this cruise I laughed to myself.
Alarms go off and our boards light up. "Team 1 deploy in 30 seconds. Bio
Science teams is in trouble."


Chapter 7.

Once we were out of the blinding plasma of the atmosphere we turned on the
external optical sensors. It is a proper shit show. The Cheyenne drop ship
is covered in drones. I checked the drop pods trajectory, I adjust it
to get us closer to the ship and put it into a steep ballistic dive. I
could see gun fire rippling out from the drop ship. Of the sentries
deployed only two remained. Alice brought up the ammo counters, they were
ripping through ammo and would be out in moments. Wham, the retros fired,
at least three xenos are boiled alive, good. The petals dropped from
the drop pod and they were on us in all directions. The chin mounted gun
fired near its cyclic rate. The driving rain helps to cool the barrel,
but only slightly. We'd landed in a triangular formation front of and aft
of each wing of the drop ship creating 120 degree overlapping fields of fire.
Marco sweeps the xenos off the drop ship, it's engines cycling up.
"Dust off in 15 seconds, thanks for backing us up!" The pilots voice comes
through the comms. As the ship rockets upward, a howl goes through the xenos.
"Freaky shit" was all Marco go out. We held out for another ten minutes until our ammo
runs out. backed against each other, molecularly sharp cutting blades
extended and we slash outwards catching a xeno here and there, but
they stay out of reach. They'd seen us before and now knew we were a
dangerous foe. At last they all rushed us. The last images before the
feed cut out was of the my heavy cutting arms snipping through the head
of a xeno as it's claws dug into the sensor dome. At least I knew I'd
killed that asshole. We knew dropping like this was a suicide mission.
This is why we were in mechs anyway. Climbing out of the pit,
"That was a shit pile." I laugh.
"We accomplished the mission at least." replied Janice. "Yeah,
we helped them bring xeno aboard, honestly, I'd have been okay with
that one failing." replies Marco.
I checked in with command. They'd lost three of the eight techs they'd
sent down. I could only hope they'd been killed. There were fates worse
than death on this forsaken rock. I tasked Alice with looking through
the footage. Only two of the three techs were accounted for. I report
my findings and make sure the team knew as well. Janice blows out a
long breath, shakes her head and walks out of the pit.


Chapter 8.


The next two weeks are stark and grinding. Now that the observation techs
knew what to look for, we kept going after nests. The first couple dozen
we landed and explored. We found the same horrors. Pigs and humans used
as breeding stock. More of the weird pale xenos. Occasionally a queen,
who to humans would have been a real foe was simply an slightly harder
xeno to kill. We eventually gave up even exploring the nests that didn't
look interesting and simply hit them from orbit with rail gun rounds.
The observation techs looked at the data and discovered more free booter
camps. Always torn to pieces. Finally we found a free booters settlement
that seemed to be intact. Dug deep into a mountain, they'd found the
right magic to keep the xenos at bay.. literally hundreds of meter of
extremely dense rock. The bored and by now cranky marines were mustered
to land. This was what they'd been waiting for. They were going to save
the civvies! Since finding the settlement all manner of comm attempts had
been made. Short band, wide band, laser wide and tight beam. All to no
avail. Two smaller nests were found a near the mountain. We dropped on
the two nests, this was the usual 'smash and stomp' as we had taken to
calling them. These nests lacked the pig pens and breeding chambers.
We'd found several of these 'Bunk houses' as we started calling them.
Frankly, it was always nice to just have to deal with angry hostile
drones. Janice finds the first weird thing. A heavily reinforced blast
door in the back wall of the farthest chamber of the nest. Team two
reports a similar thing. Optics are above both doors, our sensors showed
them active. "Someone is watching us, that's for sure." says Marco.

Alice speaks up in the channel. "I'm detecting a low power radio signal."
"Whoever or whatever you are, you are trespassing. Return to your ship, do
not return." "This is Roger Hurgs of the Colonial Marines Cyber corps
attempting to make contact with the free booters on planet LV426."
"Cyber corps? We take offense to the term free booters. Nothing is
free on this planet. We are settlers, fair and square." Here I am forty
of light years from Earth and I'm dealing with a pedant.
I take a different tact. "Apologies, settler. Mighty hostile in
these parts, we're concerned for your safety."
"We are safe and sound. Leave Acheron and return to your ship and leave
this system." Cagey and to the point. I had to admire the type of
people who were capable of battling the xenos and building themselves
a fortress. It was at this point the xenos attacked in force. Dozens
of drones came streaming into the chamber. We cut them down until our
ammo ran low, finishing the last of them with molyblades. At last we
were knee deep in xenos. The occasional head hissing and snapping at
our robotic ankles. Even with the resistant ceramic plates all of our
machines began complaining. We retreated from the dorm hive and parked
our units on the sleds. I jack out to find commander Robinson standing
in the pit with him one of the technicians from the science part of the
ship. Erikson something or other.

"This shit just keeps getting worse." he starts. This was just the way
the conversations went with him. I took a deep breath. No hello's,
no formalities, just right into it. "The techs have been examining
that weird pale xeno Janice bagged. It's been altered."
"Altered?" Janice has now jacked out as well. At this, the tech perks up,
"Yeah. It has all the hallmarks of being tinkered with by humans." he replies.
Now I am interested. "In what ways?" I
asked. "That we're still trying to figure out. Definitely smarter, not
nearly as strong." the tech replies.
"Smarter? I hope we can keep it contained." I note. I knew I was poking
a sore spot and Robinson frowns at me for it. I nod towards our ready room.
"I need coffee." All the time jacked in had turned my on again off again
headache into a grinding companion. We sat around our break table.
I explain the weird hive and the re-enforced door and the voice.
The tech pulled out a tablet and tabbed through a few screens.
"Something been bothering the geo guys since we got here. The planet
is far more along than they expected, but they couldn't figure out the
source." He connected his tablet to our wall screen and shows the projected
graph of where the terraforming should be. The graph lines are at least
twenty percent better than that. "Our intel said the first atmo plant
blowing up accounts for some of it." I reply. "Yeah, the heating,
but not the gases. Nitrogen, oxygen and a bunch of other gases are
much higher.
"Any chance you guys are collecting data on gas plums?" I
asked. The tech tinkered with the pad. "Can you overlay that with the
nest locations?" I ask. Janice and Marco get up and walk over to the
wall screen as the two maps line up.
"Holy fuck." Marco said. Commander Robinson got up and looked at the
screen, "So the Xeno's have gotten into the terraforming business?"
Janice snapped her fingers, "Those weird columns we keep finding.
They've got to their version of atmospheric processors."
This brings up so many questions. The Xenos are perfectly happy with the
planet the way it was. I had more questions to ask. I jacked in and
waded down back into the tunnel. I opened up the comm channel and just
ask the question "You modified the xenos and got them processing the
atmosphere?"

A couple of minutes go by. "Yes, we modified them. Considering it an
in-situ use of resources. Fully sanctioned by Wayland I might add. Hence
why we aren't free booters, we've got a charter, albeit a classified one.
This explained some things and posed more questions.
"Check with your higher ups, the project is known as X1243."
This tidbit of knowledge was good to know. "We'd appreciate if you'd
stop rail gunning the installations and let the controllers rebuild and
create additional nests." the voice said. "I'm not in command, but now
that we have a fully understanding of the situation, I can talk to those
in command." I reply. "Good luck with that." the voice laughs over
the comms. "I never asked who I was speaking with" I ask. "No you didn't
and I won't be saying my name on this open line in any case." the voice
replies. "Well, you'd best clear out. I've sent a message to the controllers
xenos to clean up this mess." "How do you communicate with them?" I ask.
The comm channel closes, the last question left unanswered. I leave the
tunnel and return to the sled. "Heads up, there's a large contingent of
drones and what are now known as controller xenos converging on this
location. Request extract." I say into the command channel. "Acknowledged.
We listened in, a carry all is already en route." came the reply. Over
the horizon I saw two odd things. A mass of drones and above them the carry
all. A spindley contraption designed by Wayland to be compact and simple.
The sled extendes it's carry lugs and the carry all latches on and carries
me way from the aliens. A half dozen of the controller xenos look up as the
drones streamed into the tunnel. I'm not going to say I saw intelligence,
but for a moment I swear I saw the classic head shake of disgust.


Chapter 9.


"External Ejection Triggered" pops up and fades as I found myself nose
to nose with commander Robinson in my cradle.

"We have a serious fucking problem now." his conversations starting in
the usual manner.

"How so?" I ask.

"Edgar heard that transmission and it's triggered some type of fail
safe. We're locked out of all the major systems."

I thank my lucky stars our systems were firewalled off from the rest
of the ships.

"Alice, are you still online?" I ask tentively.

"Affirmative. However, I have lost access to all ship systems." the AI
replies.

"I take it you haven't heard of Project X1243?" I ask.

"I have, but it was thought a failure." he replies. Janice, Roxxie and
Ruvi pop their heads up.

"Sir, now might be time to put our cards on the table." I point out. He
climbs out of the pit and pours himself a cup of coffee and sits down
with a huff and waved us all over.

"Everybody raise your right hands and solely swear that the information
you're about to told is to be kept strictly confidential. You will take
this information to your graves."

In unison we all said, "We solely swear."

"Sit down." he says, and we do.

"It's not widely know, but we've found the damn xenos on lots of
planets. Our grasp of bioengineering is good enough to know they were
engineered by some other species. Used as a type of forward force to prep
a planet. On many planets we've found eggs, just sitting there waiting
dormant, on other planets entire civilizations destroyed, only swarms
of drones left." he starts.

We all take this in. We'd all been exposed to the "Brighter
futures!" propaganda. Colonizing the stars kept looking grimmer by
the second.

He continues. "Wayland Yutani bio-engineers started tinkering with the
xeno's. The XNA that the xenos possess is remarkably malleable. Various
research teams came up with proposals to harness this malleability. We
figured if we can't out right destroy them, we'd co-op them. Once such
project was X1243. The idea was to turn the xenos into a controllable
labor force. Given wide latitude, the usual ethical standards were
applied."

This brings a snicker from everybody. WY is well known to place
the success of a project over the lives of people, especially low
level specialists. "It would appear this project has had some limited
success." he finishes. "I wonder what Edgar's orders were?" asks Roxxie.

Robinson rugs his chin "That I know. Upon entering orbit, it was to
try to make contact with the scientists involved with the project.
However, at last check they weren't even listening on subspace.
Our take from that was when they made planetfall they'd simply been
swarmed and destroyed."

I thought about the three simpler orders that Edgar had shown me. I
wondered what the "simple" orders the commander had been shown and what
the fuller set of orders actually were.

This is the dangers of a cagey military AIs that had their agendas set
by who knows who and given authority to accomplish those agendas.

Robinson went to the door but the access light stayed red. He waved his
hand a couple more times growing more frustrated. Finally he turns to
us. "Can somebody run a bypass on this damn door so I can get back to
the CIC?" he stammered.

Marco steps up and put the back of his hand against the door.

"Sir, I believe opening this door would be a bad idea." he replies. "Why
do you think that?" the commander asks.

"Sir, the door is ice cold. I believe this habitat spar has been
vented." he replied.

It made sense from a tactical point of view. The last thing as a computer
you need is humans running around mucking with stuff.

"Marco, isolate the door controls" I reply.

He nods, opens the panel next to the door and starts
tinkering. "Alice, outside of our isolated pod do you have any data?" I
asked. "No. I'm cut off from all our external data feeds originating
from the Edgar. I'm only getting data from automated systems." Alice replies.

The DeBe despite it's impressive bulk was actually just a serious of
stacked modules connected to four redundant load bearing spars that run
the length of the ship. Two klicks long with hard points every fifty
meters or so for various modules. Modules can be isolated, disconnected or
jettisoned. Most modules contain some level of internal redundancy.

"Alice, are any of our external sensors effected?" I asked.

"No. All sensors and comms systems in and on our module are operational."

Edgar has us on basic rations. Basically air, water and power.

"Alice, using our sensors, can you assess the state of the ship?" I
ask. A couple moments passed as Alice processes the data.

"At present the DeBraso is configured as designated in the initial
manifest." My fears that Edgar had simply dumped the modules overboard,
I'm glad that it hadn't.

"What do you think your marines are up to?" asks Ruvi.

"Regaining access to the ship I would imagine." replies the commander. The
marine combat modules (MCM's) are very robust. Ships in their own right,
they could be detach and be left in orbit if needed. I envisioned them
donning vac suits and using the airlocks to escape their module.

"Sir, do they know where your current location is?" I ask. "Likely
no. They'll head for the CIC first." he replies. Alice interjects, "I
haven't picked up any transmissions on tactical channels." At this the
commander nods, "I doubt you would. They're following SOP. I suspect
when the doors slammed shut they assumed Edgar went bug nuts and
they're talking on a tether or tight beam."

Jeremy adds to the conversation. He was the only member of our team
who'd started as a marine and moved over to the Cyber team. "It's only
been twenty minutes. I figure a couple minutes for them to figure what's
going on, five to don vac suits, five to get to the edge of their module,
the modules are in the same spare segment port and starboard side and there
are five hundred meters of storage between us and the air locks. I can
shuffle okay with mag boots, they're probably better, I figure they'll
be by our airlock in another fifteen or so minutes."

The commander nods along to this, "Probably fifteen or less. These
guys just got done doing zero-g drills the other day."

Jeremy nods back. "I'll grab a light and head to the airlock and
keep an eye out." At this he trots off at double speed.

The commander snickers, "Real shame he decided to become a geek." To
this the team all look at each other and then back at the commander,
it was clear he'd hit a nerve and realizes it.

He blew his cheeks out in his classic fashion, "He was a good marine,
it just seemed and odd choice."

Ruvi cleared his throat, "Sir, he is a marine, as are we." To this the
commander nodded. "I appreciate the training and hardwork you people
put in, it's just outside of our standards."

I could see this entire converation going off the rails.

"I definitely think this conversation is important, but right now let's
focus on the problems at hand."

Robinson could see I was saving his bacon a bit and picks up on the
theme. "What are your current capabilites?" he asked.

We detail our current load out and equipment on the ground as well as
options for deploying our additional rockies shipside.

Jeremy come jogging into the room with six marines in tow, helmets
under arms.

"Sir, I found these guys on our doorstep." replied Jeremy.

The commander turned to the marines. "Status report."

The lead marine starts in, "Both habitable spars are vented to
space. Three guys are MIA, presumed lost. The CIC was also vented, you
were assumed lost with the other people in the CIC. Glad to see you're
alive. Both marine combat modulars are intacted. We've disabled the door
controls to Edgar won't try to vent us."

"Status of the other MCM module?" the commander asks. "Locked down as
well. We knocked on the door and they knocked back. Our first priority was
the CIC until we saw Jeremy flashing out "SOS" with a light at us.
Another weird thing you should know, one of the storage modules as
extended large diamond shaped antennae. We didn't get near them. None
of us knew what they were for."

More secret squirrel bullshit was what it sounded like to me. "Roxxie,
please investigate those antennas." She nodded and headed towards
the pit. "Alice, please put Roxxie's feeds up on the main wall." I
say. "Roger that." replies Alice. I smile as the Marines look around
momentarily before realizing that our modules has it's own AI.
In short order we got a view of Roxxie crabbing her rocky across
the surface of the ship.

Sure enough from one of the storage modules long spindly antenna had
extended out several hundred meters. "Alice, please identify." I ask
aloud. "Unknown, does not fit any known antenna configuration in my
databanks" replies the AI.
Janice speaks up at this, "More project X1243 stuff I'd bet."
I agreed on this part, there were more moving parts to this and I've
now found myself with five cyber jockies, a handful of marines, a
commanding officer and a tech nerd.

The commander speaks up at this point to the marines,
"Establish contact with the other MCM. Use tethers, who knows what
those those antenna can pick up. See if you can get to the CIC and
reestablish control of this ship." At that Jeremy hustles them back
to the airlock.

Reestablish control of the ship means crippling Edgar.
"Sir, was the subspace radio to earth ever brought back online?" I ask.
He laughs and pulls out a credit card sized module from his pocket.
"I doubt without this, much got fixed."
He's holding a Magnetically Intertwined Confined Particle. There's a
couple different acrnoyms for them. In subspace school we called them
MICP's or Mikey's. Everybody here just calls them PIPs. I'm sure there's
some other backronyms for it as well but it was why the deep space radio
wasn't working.
"I pulled it when we came out of transit." he notes.
"Why?" I asked.
"Do you like having every one of your orders countermanded, debated,
looked over, argued over from hundreds of light years away?" he asks.
I could see his frustration, but I also knew this was an excuse.
Janice speaks up, "Fine, we put that in one of our subspace radios and
call home."
I shake my head, "It doesn't work that way. It comes down to how many
hawkings you can generate to create the tunnel. Our modules systems barely create
a hundredth of a hawking, the DeBe's deep space transmitter generates a field
in the hundreds."
Jeremy speaks up, "Okay then, we put on vac suits and go install it." To this
I laugh, "Ironically if we tell Edgar we have this, he'll probably let us
install it."
The commander then scoffs, "He'd probably then lock the doors
in the engine section and cook us."
I couldn't disagree with that logic.
To accent his point, the the alarms start sounding.


Chapter 10.

Klaxons echo through the module, every light pulses bright red.
Alice goes to full volume on all channels, "General breach alarm
detected in science module!"
Janice throws her hands up, "How am I not surprised!"
"Alice, kill the alarm!" I howl. Immediately the alarms cut out.
"Stow it." I say. "Roxxie, can you see anything outside?" I ask.
"Yes. The marines went to the CIC module but were unable to open
the door. They just returned to the port side MCM. Sir, the
starboard MCM just detached and is tumbling."
"Alice, any danger to us?" I ask.
"No. Based on current trajectory, the module will enter the
atmosphere in approximately two hours, eight minutes." The
AI replies.
"Alice, any more alerts?" I ask. Alice pipes back in,
"No. Just the repeating breach alarm."
"Alice, Any idea what tripped it?" I ask.
"Unknown. Unable to access ship net." replies Alice.
"Roxxie can you see any of the air locks?" I ask.
"Sir, its tumble is slow, on next rotation I will see if the airlocks
are intact." she replies.
"That doesn't look like a very controlled detach." I point out.
"No. I wouldn't expect Marines to do that. They've got plenty of
firepower, I'd expect them to deal with the xeno." replies
the commander.
"Sir, I've got a visual on airlock number one." Roxxie calls out.
On the screen we could see the airlock and what clearly
is blood splattered on the inside. "Maybe they ditched to isolate the
xeno?" Jeremy asks. At this the tech spoke up,
"Possibly. That doesn't account for the other xeno material."
We stop and looked at the tech. He turns and looks at the commander
who nods. "After you cleared out the processing plant we found several
intact eggs. We encased them and they were brought onboard with the xeno."
Marc lets out a slow and exaggerated "Ffuucckk."
I don't disagree with that sentiment. "How many is several?" I
ask. "Four." the tech replies. "Hopefully encased in something stronger
that first container." Marco quips. "Yes. A resin embedded with micro
particles of a strong base capale of  neutralizing the xenos acid." the
tech replies. I could see the team mulling this over.
"This material was tested?" asks Marco. The tech shrugs,
"I was told it would hold them." "We need to get into that module and
assess the situation." I order. Robinson
could see that I am starting to take charge and wants to make sure he was
still the top dog. Nodding along, "This module is your show, I'm going to
get over into the other MCM and see what I can do from there. Use your
rockies to investigate that science module and relay the information to
our MCM via the tether." "What about the other MCM?" asks Janice. "It's
got power, while the tumble is uncontrolleed once atmospheric drag
starts automatic systems will engage, it'll land of it's own accord. I
need to worry about the here and now. Figure out what's going on in
that science module." Roxxie speaks up, "Sir, I'm proceeding to
the science module and breech if needed?" I look at the commander, he
nods. "Permission granted." I say. Despite the commanders talk of heading
over to the other MCM, he sats down and watchs Roxxie's feed. In that
moment I think he realizes likely the safest spot to be is here. Crawling
on the nadar side of the ship she makes her way to the science modules
external hard point and airlock. Extending her smaller dexterous hands
she manipulates the controls, when that fails she overrides the controls
and enters the airlock closing the external door behind her. Carefully
she opens the inner door, to cavernous darkness. Immediately shifting
to infrared, she launches a drone. The science module is a mess. Drawers
ripped open, lab equipment strewn across counters and floor. It looks like
it had been an ugly fight. The tech who I now knew as Eric quietly says,
"The eggs are stored in the room to your right." Roxxie extends one of
her large manipulator arms and opens the door a crack to allow the drone
in. The drone does a juke and slips through the crack. Against the far
wall four isolation chambers are lit by a blue lights. The four containers
smashed, the eggs open, the petal peeled back, their horrifying contents
missing. "You getting this?" asked Roxxie. "Five by five." I reply.
"So much for your fucking wonder material" huffs Marco. Roxxie opens the
door and the drone flies out, laser and doppler mapping as it goes. Roxxie
moves her rocky deeper into the science module. "How many people were
in this module?" she asks. "Fourteen" I reply. Across the hall the
holding cell is open, the pale xeno missing.
"No signs it forced its way out." Roxxie notes.
Alice speaks up, "MCM 2 has reoriented and is firing
retro rockets for re-entry. I've plotted its approximate landing site."
"Let us known when it's landed." I reply. Deeper into the science module,
the xeno had converted a meeting room into a hatchery. Four people are
cocooned against the wall. All dead, their chests burst open.

Seeing this Eric let out a moan, "No." and begins to weep. The floor is
littered with the remains of the other nine scientists. The recognition
software automatically counting bodies but unable to easily identify
them. They'd been consumed. Roxxie let out a sigh, "All accounted
for." Ruvi speaks up, "Where are the xenos then?" he asks quietly. It
is a question we are all wondering.


Chapter 11.


Immediately Robinson gets on the tether to the MCM,
"Be advised there are possibly up to five xenos onboard. One pale and
likely four standard drones." A voice I know well, Wikowsky comes back.
"Roger that, motion trackers are deployed. We sent a fire team down
the main spar a half an hour ago to attempt to access the CIC and
disconnect Edgar. So far, no word. My only experience with somewhat
sentient AI's was Alice. The fact that a four man fire team had been
gone for half an hour and they weren't sending people out to look for
them made think it wasn't going too well. Edgar had already depressurized
the ship and apparently killed the crew in the CIC, I wondered idly
what Alice might do if the mission parameters were more important than
our lives.

Roxxie speaks up, "I've got something." We turned our attention back to
the feed. Roxxie's rocky is holding a bulkhead hatch with long tear marks
in it. "Looks like they decided to get into the utility spars."

These damn things are clever, I'd give them that. The utility spars run
the length of the ship. Tubes of durasteel full of hand holds, cables and
pipes, not created for a human to stroll down but for xenos who have a
weird fetish about climbing around in tight spaces, it's perfect.
Immediately my mind begins to work and worry about the ingress points
to this module. I speak up, "Roxxie, see if you can get to the habitat
spar and aid the other marines." "Roger that. I'll keep you posted."
comes a reply. I have three rockies on the ground, one in the science
lab and two more currently in the maintenance bay as well as two more
as assembled spares and enough parts to probably
get a half dozen more up and running.

I looked at Ruvi, "Jack in and get your rocky positioned in front of the
panel to the utility access." I don't even get a "yes sir" before Ruvi
takes off for the pit to jack in. I can see the look on the commanders
face, he'd have chewed someone out for such a lack of protocol. My module,
my rules. The problem I have now is a lack access to the cameras in
the habitable spars. I know they were depressurized but I didn't know
what was going on. Alice breaks this train of thought.

"Sir, there's a radio call coming in on the surface directed to you."
"From who?" I asked. "Origin unknown, triangulated to a surface
transmitter six hundred and fifty meters from rocky one, the
message is repeating." Alice replies. "Play it" I say. Immediately the
room is filled with the voice I'd spoken to earlier.
"This message is for Hurgs. Please contact us on this frequency, ASAP."
Alice then says, "The message just repeats."
"Alice, what is the current location of our rockies in relation to
the cave we were in earlier?" I ask. "Approximately nine hundred and
fifty meters." it replies. I'd been ejected as the carry all had lifted
off, I didn't actually know where my rocky was. I drop into my cradle
and initiate a fast jack as it's called.

I find myself on the sled on a low plateau, the storm in the north
seems even angrier than the last time I'd jacked in. Because of the
fast jack, not everything is fully synced up yet. Details are still
filling in. Waves of rain lash across the sensor bulb. Ironically
this rocky literally has everything, but lacks wipers, blowers or
sonics to keep the rain off. I bring the radio online and boost
its power to the max. I also configure the channels so that my audio
will bounce into the meeting room.

"This is Hurgs responding." I watch as a timer ticks. Thirty
seconds elapse. "I repeat this is PFC cyper specialist Hurgs." Then
I hear it, a faint crackle, then the power boosts up. "Hurgs, we hear
you. What have you guys done? The drones have gone crazy!" the voice says
faintly. "Sir, please explain." I say. "After our last message, I called
the controllers to clean up the the mess you made with your robots.
Things went normally, then suddenly the controllers stopped responding
to our commands. Drones attempted to breach our compounds. We've stayed
secure but we've lost contact with the beta site and the main habitat
site." In my ear I hear Janice on a side channel, "I don't think any
of this is a coincidence." I agree. The mentioning of project X1243,
the sudden sprouting of the antenna, the weird behavior of Edgar, the
drones, the controllers, the opened confinement cell and the smashed
eggs. "Okay. I'm about a klick away from the entrance to your tunnel,
do you need me to clean that tunnel out?" I ask. "No currently there
only a handful of drones and a single controller. Once they were unable
to breach our defenses they left." the voice replies. "We found the
location of the beta site, where is the location of your main habitat
compound?" At this there is a pause, I'm sure there are others in
the background likely not that excited to give away such a vital piece
of intel. To me, this pause seems crazy.

I open a side channel to the main room with the commander.
"Robinson, should I let them know about what's going on the Debe?" I ask.
A pause at our end this time.. "No. We don't know these people or
their capabilities. I have no reason to trust these people. This guy,
who I should remind you hasn't told us his name, said a magic word that
managed to fuck us up and get more than a couple marines killed." came
the response. I had to grudgingly agree with the commander. Shit truly
had gone sideways once he said the project name. On the other hand it
looked like his goose was getting cooked as well. "Okay Hurgs, the main
habitat is about 250km north of this current location at
the base of a formation we call "Hadley's chin." Immediately Alice brings
up a topo map and it was clear why they called it that. A prominence of
rock, wide and square.

"I see it on the topo map. There's serious storm
brewing though." I reply.

"Yes. The queens crown we call it. A product
of the original detonation, the storm has been raging for a couple of
decades, we're now in the season when it really ramps up. Between it and
the xeno's it's why we ended up under ground. Hurgs, you asked before,
the names Zeigler." comes a reply.

"Glad to finally put a name to the voice, I'm going to investigate the
beta site and we'll get people to the habitat." I say.
"Thanks. Keep me posted." he replies. At that the
comm channel goes dead.

"Alice, please plot a course to the beta site,
let me know when rocky one is five hundred meters out." I say. "Roger
that. Course plotted. ETA nineteen minutes. My mind registeres that is
a steady fifty six point eight kilometers an hour. Gotta love implants!
I eject from the cradle, climb out of the pit and head back to the
conference room.

"Zeigler, eh? Didn't expect to find that mother fucker on this
rock." laughs the commander. That's going to merit some explanation. I
grabbed a cup of coffee, a snack packet and pain meds. Fast jacking is a
sure fire way to end up in bed stunned if you do it too often. Already
I could feel the tightness in my temples and I have a slight tremor in
my left arm. The commander looks at my arm and then me. I simply shrug,
"Dangers of cybernetics." I laugh.

"So who is this Zeigler guy you seem so fond of?" I ask.
To this, the commander just laughs.

"Oh Mike and I go way back, you could say we haven't seen eye to eye
about the xenomorphs since day one." The prospect of story time brings
people to the table. Seeing that he had an audience, the commander sits
back and folds his hands across broad his chest.
"Dr. Mike Ziegler is a brilliant scientist who falls into the category
of men too consumed with the could, they never stop to ask if they should.
To him, he sees the xenomorph and their straightforward bio-engineering
as an opportunity. He calls it a gift from the gods. He's convinced he
can tame the damn things, use them as a labor force, communicate with
them. I attended more than a half dozen proposals where he spoke of using
what they'd learned to create a whole bestiary of creatures that can work
in conditions we wouldn't even want to send robots. Based on what you've
reported, it appears he's had some success, and based on his latest radio
messages, as usual when dealing with the xenomorph's invariably these
scientists bite off more than they can chew." at that he puts his hands
on the table.

Turning to me, he says sternly, "This guy is a snake in the grass. Results
driven to a level that would make Wayland VP blush, he's shrewd and smart.
To quote an old North American thing that they used to say before they'd
arrest you, everything you say can and will be used against you. Think
before you speak. Whatever his charter was with project X1243, the only
info I had was that we were to make contact. The details were entirely
lacking. I don't even know how many people are here or where was his
charter. Hell, I didn't he was here. To be fair my first inclination
would have been to nuke the entire site from orbit on principle!"
I nod taking this in. "So this scientist is some kinda of megalomanic
loon who will stop at nothing until he creates super xenos?"
I laugh. Robinson just shakes his head, "You've already seen the leader
xeno's. He's already doing that, who knows what other horrors he's
cooked up." Janice who'd sat silent speaks up, "I'd like to know how
he's communicating with them."

Alice breaks in, "The secondary MCM has made landfall successfully."
On the screen the location is plotted. It put it nearly fifty klicks from
the entry to the main habitat site. Marco quips, "Geez, if anybody
is still alive in that module, the last twenty minutes must have
felt like a ride in an auto dryer."
"Any comms from the module?" I ask Alice.
"No. Emergency beacon only. However, the module may be transmitting
on low power. I lack resources to evaluate that." comes the reply. I turn
to Jeremy. "Prep and drop your rocky on that module." Jeremy replies
with a crisp "Yes Sir." and makes haste to the pit. The commander nods
approvingly. "What's your plan?" asked the commander.

"That MCM is full of weapons and hopefully functional marines. Worse
case we can hand out weapons to civvis, best case, we'll have functional
marines and we'll hand out weapons to civvis." "I'm hearing a lot of hope
in that plan." Robinson notes. That is the truth. If dozens and dozens of
xenos decide to storm your position, short of a tactical nuke, your options
run out quickly. But the MCM did have point defense weapons that could
easily shred a xeno. Hope is all I'm running on at this point.

"Sir, I've landed a fifty meters from the MCM. Landing struts deployed,
it looks functional." Jeremy's voice comes over the comms. "Any sign of
marines?" asks Robinson. "Negative." replies Jeremy. On the main screen
Jeremy's rocky approaches the MCM. Wreathed in steam, audible pops and
clicks as the module cools aided by the driving rain flashing to steam
give the module an ethereal look. Approaching the main airlock, it is
apparent there had been a hell of a fight inside. Jeremy punches an
override code into the airlock and both doors open.

Out of the airlock a drone launches itself at the rocky. The machine
rocks back from the blow, bringing his heavy manipulators up Jeremy slams
the drone into the ground. He drags the kicking and thrashing xeno a few
yards from the module, gripping the xenos in his pincers he pins it
to the ground and puts single ten mil AP round through its head, it's
green blood splashes the ground and sizzles. I had to give Jeremy
credit for the brutal efficiency of it. We'd had two weeks of slogging
through drones. Dozens of times they'd leapt on the Rockies. While the
commander and the tech had jumped we hadn't. Just another horrifying
day at the office. Laughing he zooms into the shoulder of the drone,
an ugly gash from below the neck to the armpit.

"God Damn! That's the work of a vibrablade!" The commander grins.
His marines had put up a fight. Climbing into the MCM, it's a horror
scene. Two dead marines lay on the module floor one of them holding a
shattered vibrablade. The other slashed across the chest. Jeremy plugs
into the general quarters system. "This is private Hopkins. The xeno
has been dealt with."

"Hopkins? Jesus I'm glad to hear your voice" comes a reply. At this
the armored door to the armory opens. A half dozen fully kitted
marines tumbled out, see the rocky and stop.
"Ah fuck Henderson and Alverez really did it!" one of them says.
"Wrestled a fucking xeno to the ground and nearly took its head off
with a viroblade!" The marines stood around their fallen comrades.
"A hero's death." says another. At once they beat their chests and say
"Oh-Rah."
"What happened?" asks Jeremy. They all turn their attention
back to the rocky. "Fucking thing came out of the access panel and landed
on Alverez. When we lost contact with everybody, we kitted up. Henderson
slammed the door and as the doors shut he yelled he was going to "take
care of it" drawing his vibrablade.
Looking at Henderson's body he took a breath. "Then we lost gravity and
started tumbling. We strapped in and watched onthe external monitors.
The Xeno beat against the door but it was clear it was getting thrown
around the module. We waited until landfall because we knew a ten mil would pop
us like a balloon. The plan was to pop the door and shredding the fucker
when you showed up." Jeremy focuses on the marine whose name plate reads Fisher.
"Corporeal Fisher, Welcome to the Asheron. I'd advise you get to a terminal
and get the point defenses up and running." Nodding another marine immediately
gets to a terminal. "Apparently there's some scientists here who had some
control over the xeno's and that's all gone to hell. They're hold up in
some compound fifty clicks from here. Hurgs is heading over to their other
research base or something." Fisher nods. "Glad to have your rocky and
the extra firepower."
Jeremy replies back "Roger that. With Edgar acting up, this unit won't
be going anywhere soon. To this Fisher perks up, "What the fuck happened?"
"Dunno. Something to do with these scientists, it triggered some failsafe.
I don't know anymore." replies Jeremy.

A marine comes up to Fisher, "Sir, I've got the point defenses on line,
but the weather is playing hell with the system. I'm seeing movement five
hundred meters out, but I can't make much of it." At this Jeremy backs his
Rocky out of the unit and they close the airlocks. The two marines in body
bags have been placed under the MCM. "Sir, I'm going to launch a drone
to get a better vantage point."

"Sounds good. We're pretty blind up here without Edgar." I reply. Jeremy
launches the drone. Quickly Alice starts integrating the input.
The MCM has landed among at least eight nests, the nearest is about
a hundred and fifty meters away. Jeremy jokes over the channel,
"Picked the right side to land on!" We all nod. He could have easily
bingoed right on a nest opening. One rocky is pretty badass, but on
flat ground against an unknown number of drones, it's at best a
delaying action. Roxxie joins into the channel. "Sir, I've managed to
open the door to the main habitat spar, you'll want to see this." On
the monitors, the feet of a marine are seen sticking out of a vent,
frozen blood has pooled around the ankles. Another marine is on the
floor his helmet and face mask a shattered ruin. Past this the entire
corridor has been plastered with the alien resin. "Looks like they were
ambushed." Roxxie smashes her way through the resin and her rocky
finds itself nose to nose with xenos  hallway and behind them the
controller xeno. It's brief and bloody. Roxxie obliterates all
three in moments. The blood splashes against the corridor walls
and begins to eat into them. "I was afraid of that." she says.
Alice pipes up, "Structural integrity warnings from habitat spar
two grid section 43." We all nod. Three xenos worth of blood can
do plenty of damage.

"Alice, how serious is this?" I ask. "Full extent of damage unknown.
Gladiator ships are build with a high level of redundancy." I've worked
with Alice long enough to read between the lines. Shit is broken, but
the AI is too cagey to say things are outright dire.

Alice pipes up with more info, "Rocky one is now five hundred meters
from the entrance to the beta site." I head back into the pit and
this time I do a clean jack in. Seeing the weather on the screen and
experiencing it through the neural jack are two different things. Heat
lightning crackles across the sky and rain lashes the rocky. At least
I didn't have to worry about waste heat. The trash can sized nuclear
reactor at the core of my rocky is pumping out serious amounts of power.
Under some circumstances cooling such a thing would be a problem.
I checked the power levels and was pleased to see that even over two
weeks of daily use, the reactor had only used a couple percentage of its
fuel.

I idly wonder what fresh hell I am descending into. I am now a hundred
and seventy five meters out. I stop the sled and contemplate my options.
I'm a single rocky, I need to play this smart.

"Alice, launch a drone to give me over watch and send one down the tunnel
to see what I'm up against." Immediately adrones takes off from the sled.
I ride shotgun as Alice dives the little saucer shaped ariel vehicle down
into the opening.

In the center chamber I can see a durasteel door like at the alpha site,
but peeled from the wall on one side. They couldn't go through it, so
they simply went around it. The drone spuns in the center of the chamber
sending lidar pulses down the tunnels that radiated out. No movement,
but we knew better. In a moments notice xenos could can out of every damn
crevice. Alice moves the drone through peeled gap of the doors. The rough
surfaces gave way to a clinical gleam lab. On emergency power and with
smashed lights an eerie flicker of yellow emergency lights fill the lab
with an errie glow. The scene is grizzly. Blood streak the walls. Cages
are broken open, lab equipment is smashed. There was a level of violence
here that shocks me. Freezers are ripped open, their shelves and vials
scattered. This was beyond the base xeno need to find vessels to reproduce,
this was hate filled. The drone flies on, the horrors grow. Robinson had
been right, Ziegler had been a busy man. Alice stops in front of a stasis
tube, the upper half of an armless drone floats in the water, electrodes
bristle from it's elongated head. Alice flies on.

Lying dead in a hospital bed is girl, clearly a hybrid of
human and xeno XNA/DNA. Her angelic face is contrasted against her bio
mechanical head wearing a crown of electrodes. Her chest is slashed
open. The gleam of bio mechanical anatomy and petite human features are
intermixed in an elegant way. Despite all the horror and the gore I
have to admit that she is or was beautiful. Scattered around her are
busted tablets and building block toys. I have no way of estimating
her age, but my thinking is that she couldn't be more than ten.

Janice gasps "What in the unholy christ has this madman been doing?"
she whispers.
Robinson just snickers, "What he always dreamed to do. Get far away
from anyone who would ask any questions and play god."
I agree with him on this. The drone flies down a couple tunnels but
finds nothing. This site is a tomb.

I bring the radio up to full power. "Hurgs here, calling Zigler." 
I get an immediate reply, "Zielger here. What's the status of the
Beta site?" he asks.

"Destroyed" I reply flately. Over the link I hear a heavy sigh.
"In the lab there was a very special young girl." he says.
"She's dead." I reply. "Her name was Eliana." he whispers flatly
over the link. Clearly, this is a heavy blow to him.
"I didn't find any survivors. The lab had been wrecked." I reply.
At this I hear him take a deep breath and let it out.
"Any status on the main habitat?" he asks. "We've got people fifty
clicks out and we're formulating a plan." I reply.

"Well, formulate faster. If what I'm being told is correct, there's
a large assault being planned." he replies. Janice whispers in my
ear in our side channel, "How can he know that?"
I reply back, "He's got more of these hybrids, it must be his link
to the controller xeno's."
"Please define large scale." I ask.. "That I don't know. But I can
easily guess, hundreds? I also think the controllers
have made some deal with the queens."
Just fucking wonderful.. the millipede worth of shoes kept dropping.
"Ziegler, when were you going to let us in on this?" I ask.
"I'm learning this now I promise. Please get your troops to the main
habitat."

Alice now whispered in my ear, "Based on vocal strain, this person
Ziegler is under extreme stress."
Thanks Alice. I appreciat the analysis and it confirms my fears.
"Is the Alpha site still intact?" I ask. "Barely. They've been pounding and
scratching around the door for an hour, but don't seem to be making much
headway.

"They undermined the door in the beta facility, it sounds like they're
using that tactic as well." I reply.

"Shit. I know I just sent you to the beta site, but I think I'm in
trouble here." he replies. I sense the sled shifting under my feet.
"I can be there in twenty minutes." Alice points out that
she can probably push it and do it in less. I agree with the AI, now that
the track has been made it's not worried about flipping the sled. She
wasn't kidding. The AI is pours on the speed. Even in the driving rain,
the sled is easily doing seventy. I see the steam coming up from the sled,
as its reactor is running at max power. I ask Alice to keep me posted
and keep the drones flying.

Janice pings me to head to the conference room, I cleanly eject. I wander in
to some seriously long faces. "What's up?" I ask.
Roxxie is sitting at the table. "I finally found the other xeno." she
replies. "That's good?" I ask. "Yes, and no. That fucker is dead, but
not before they managed to tear into the food, broke a bunch of stuff
in the muster module and then made its way down to the
engine module and tried and thankfully failed to do any damage.
"Any thing about Edgar?" I ask.
Ruvi shrugged. "Still doing whatever its crazy cyber brain is doing.
The CIC module is still intact, and the xeno's are all dead so we should
be able to get in there and at least disconnect him if not more."
Janice laughs at this. "There's also the damage that was done to the
habitat spar. I've run some calculations and it's going to be real dodgy
getting up to super luminal speed with that spar."
I trusted Janice in this regard, she'd started as an engineer before getting
recruited into the program. I turned to Robinson,
"Think you can persuade some marines to go unplug a crazy computer?" He nods and
gets on the tether and starts dishing out orders. Quickly Marines
make their way to the CIC. Edgar is isolated from the DeBe. Hatches are
closed, sections are re-pressurized. Finally we start to get a handle
on the ship. Getting home without Edgar is going to be complicated, but
that's a bridge we'll burn when we get there. Robinson makes a show of
it returning to the CIC like a triumphant hero, I'm glad to have him out
of my hair.

Chapter 12.

"Hurgs, Are you there? Hurry up!!" I hear over the radio.
I don't even need Alice to analyze his voice, he's freaking out.
Alice has now unlocked the safties and it running the reactor at a
hundred and eighteen percent of safe power output.
Janice Marco and Ruvi are both ten minutes out dropping in an almost
perfectly ballistic arcs.
"Hurgs here. We are a couple minutes out." I reply.
"They've breached the facility. We have moved to a secure room
and are engaging in a holding action."
Janice speaks up, "With what?"
I agree. Looking at the last facility it didn't look like much
resistance had been put up.
Cresting a low hill I see the mass of drones in the distance and they see me.
A howl and a ripple of turning xenomorph heads announces my arrival.
A troop of Xeno split off and start running in my direction.
"Alice, goal keep at fifty yards." I say.
"Engagement threshold set." the AI says into my ear.
In this moment I appreciated Marco loading additional ammo onto
this sled.
"ETA in about two minutes." Janice calls out over the subspace comms.
Alice highlights the two streaks in the sky.
"Good. It's a shit show!" I laugh.
"Roger that, Alice is giving us great video." she laughs back.
"It looks like there are three distinct groups" notes Marco.
He's right. I can see two queens each with their own armies and I can
a trio of controller xenos surrounded by their own troop of xenos.
"Jesus, that's a shitload of Xenos" laughs Marco.
By my automated count, there were at least forty full sized xenos per
queen plus a fair number of their "attending" xenos.
"Sir, what's the plan?" asks Janice.
"Drop right in the middle of them, fire retros as low as you can." I reply.
The plan almost works. Some of the xenos must have seen the play before
others seemed confused. The three rockys drop out of the sky their retros
firing fifteen meters above the ground. Dozens of xenos caught in the
rocket down wash explode as their blood flash boils. The con of being
vacuum tight.
Better prepared for what is ahead their Rocky's are kitted up to kill.
"Too bad we have to save these civi's. Now that we've got the DeBe's guns
back online this would have been an easy one." laughs Marco.
He's not wrong. A couple railgun rounds and we'd be in the mess eating.
"We know the drill, let's clear a path to the entrance." to make the point
I continue to maneuver my sled closer. Pinched in from four sides, the
xeno's throw themselves at our rocky's. A trio of fourty millimeter
grenades sends the largest of the queens to hell. Janice manages to shred
the other queen. The controller xeno's spread out and make themselves
scarce. I give Alice the priority to target them in particular. Alice
at this point shows her true AI power. Targetting and dropping xeno's
with blinding efficency, all four of our rocky's dump grenade and ten
mil HE rounds as we move towards the entrance.
"Save ammo. Only fire on drones that come inside a ten meter exclusion
zone." Everybody ackowledges this. It doesn't take long before battle
lines are drawn.
"Ruvi, Marco, hold the entrance, Janice you're with me." I order.
Both acknowledge. We decend back down into the alpha site. We know
the layout well at this point and head right for the armored door.
The wall next to the door is undermined. Alice launches a drone
through the gap. Together our rocky's rip the door from its hinges.
"Zigler, we are in the facility." I radio.
"Finally. Go straight in at the tee junction, head right. Kill
everything." he replies.
"Roger that." I reply.
Much like the Beta site, high tech lab equipment punchuated by
macabe experiments are everywhere. More twisted hybrids. A xeno
float in tanks with six arms. Drones a mix of some draft animal
and xeno DNA lay dead in pens.
Throught the link I can feel Janice's disgust. I know that Marco
would have been entirely too distracted by the experiments.
We get to the junction and head right and come face to face
with a controller xeno. Janice's virbrablade cleaves the xeno
diagnally with a single slice. From there it's a wall to wall
shooting gallery. The xeno's attempt to box us in as more come
from the other left hallway. Focusing ahead on the door, I ask
Alice to take care of them. Targeted shots drop the first row,
the second row stop at the junction and simply snarl. I'm down
to fifty seven ten mil rounds and three fourty mil grenades.
"Hostiles in the left corridor seem to be hanging back, should
we clean them out?" I ask over the radio link.
"As long as we have a path to the surface we should be fine."
comes a reply.
I hear the sound of a heavy blast door retract.
Out comes an older man with salt and pepper hair and a young girl,
another hybrid.
"This is Elizabeth. I've set the self destruct set, I just need
to trigger it." he says outloud, holding up a palm sized trigger.
I realize I need to turn on the external speakers.
"Roger that. Let's move." I say. Janice's rocky moves back into
the tee. The xeno's there back away. We notice the moment our guns
swivel away from them, they attempt to creep closer.
We back our way out of lab and into the main tunnel.
In our mission channel is explain the situation.
I can almost sense Marco's glee.
"How do you think these xeno's are going to react when you come
out of the tunnel with that hybrid girl?" asks Ruvi.
I'd been wondering this myself. I get the sense that the xeno's
aren't that keen on Ziegler's experimenting.
"Dr. Ziegler, we've got a fifty meter climb to the surface, there
are alot of drones up there." Extending one of my smaller dexterous
hands I point at Elizabeth. "How are they going to take seeing
her?" I ask.
He turns to Elizabeth. "What is the current mind state?" he asks.
"Confusion. Anger. Yearning command." she replies.
Ziegler scratchs his chin. "You managed to kill the queens, did
you get any of the controller's?" he asks.
"No. The disappeared as soon as we engaged the drones." I reply.
"Those particular controllers are wily." he replies.
Just great. So there are even smarter xeno's.
I opened a channel to just Alice. "Since you are scanning all
the feeds if any of the controller aliens show up, alert us"
"Roger that. CPU time set aside to do dedicated image analysis."
replies Alice.
Ziegler turns back to Elizabeth, "Reassure them that there is
control" he says.
At this the girl puts her head down. "This is going to be
harder without the harness." she replies.
"I know, but you must try."
Over the radio Marco speaks up, "Guys, the drones are
being weird up here."
"Define weird." I reply.
"They're formed groups of eight and put their heads together."
he replies.
"Ziegler, my guys topside are saying that the drones are putting
their heads together." I say through the speaker.
"Good. It might be working." he says.
At this she starts crying. "They're not listening to me. All
they want is to listen to her."
It occurs to me at this moment, while a hybrid she's a child
being put in a horrible situation.
He hugs her, "No worries, keep trying."
"I think we're going to have to run and gun." I say outloud.
I can see the look on their faces.
"To where?" asks Ziegler.
"I figure either up to the DeBe or to the Marines on the ground.
In either case standing around here, eventually the drones
on the ground are going to get sick of this and come for us."
I reply.
"Could you take them all out?" Zeigler asks.
I see the look on Elizebeths face. The idea of killing drones
bothers her. As I look at her closer I can see she's even a
stronger mix of bio mechanical and human.
Janice whispers into the side channel, "Let's call a drop ship
down and get ourselves over to the MCM module. If this poor
creature finds herself on the ship she'll never touch firm
ground again."
I don't disagree with her, but her odds of surviving here are
pretty shitty as well.
I look at where we are in orbit and our choices suck. Doing
the math, even if we dropped a ship now, it's going to be a half
hour out.
I open a side channel to Robinson and explain the situation.
"I have half a mind to hit the entire site from orbit and wash
my hands of this whole sorry affair, but I'm not going to do
that. That girl or thing seems to have some way to control the
xeno's, I think that's a worthy asset to keep."
This was Robinson for you, nothing a railgun round can't fix.
"Sir, once we're clear of this area, I'd recommend that, but
we'll need to move a considerable distance considering the
biologicals we'll have in tow." I reply.
Returning my focus to situation at hand.
"Ruvi and Marco, When I give the signal I'm going to need you
two to draw off the xeno's. Don't hold back.
"Yes sir!" came a hardy reply.
"Each of you is going to ride one of our rockies, when
we get out of the tunnel these rockies are going to
head straight for our overland vechiles called sled. There
aren't any real handholds, and we plan on going rather
fast." I say outloud.
They both nod in understanding.
"Elizabeth, this is Janice's rocky." I say.
At this Janice extends her smaller manipulator hands.
"Eliabeth, why don't you ride on my back, you can use
the smaller set of hands as a seat."
She nods and climbs on board the rocky.
"Dr. Ziegler, you're with me." I say and I extend my
smaller arms. He climbs onboard and situates himself.
"How big is this blast going to be?" I ask.
"Big. When I pull the trigger the fusion plant is going
to go prompt critical." he says.
Janice whispers to me, "That's one way of getting rid
of the evidence. That's going to be easily a five kiloton
blast. We're going to need to be thirty kilometers away."
I'd also done those calculations and they matched up.
"Ziegler. Don't trigger that thing until we're far away."
I say.
"Don't worry. I rather like living." he replies.
"Guys it sounds like this might be a suicide mission" I say
over the link.
"Yeah, we figured that going in, we packed for a fight."
replies Ruvi.
"Light'em up boys!" I tell them.
Alice's drone gives us a birds eye view of the action.
Both their drones had dropped their manipulator arms in
favor of additional gun and ammo hard points. Blazing arcs
of fire ripped out into the xeno's. To their credit they
charged the two rocky's. 
"Behind us!" Janice yells. Sure enough charging out of
tunnels dozens of drones come up behind us. Fuck, I knew
this was too easy. Our two rocky's burst out of the
tunnel entrance to lashing rain and screaming xeno's.
A half dozen xeno's come out of the tunnel and head
straight for us. I can only imagine to the xeno's she
must be a beacon in the dark.
Janice speaks up in the chat, "She's hissing and saying
they're coming, they're coming over and over."
"Janice, see if she can confuse them." I say.
Our sleds maneauver themselves so we can get on board.
Ruvi is shifts to our flank and unloads a dozen
grenades down the tunnel entrance. The shockwave
eminates from the tunnel. Knocking a couple of the drones
at the entrance down. A single drone crawls out
of the entrance, it's body a wrecked mess.
The others are now looking around confused.
"Whatever she's doing, it's working" I say to Janice.
"She's mumbling something about the devourer." she replies.
Lovely, that sounds like more fun.
Crazily enough both Ruvi and Marco have managed to
whittle the xeno's down to a hissing mass that's using
cover to manuveur around the rocky's.
The shits are moving tactially, I honestly don't love it.
They're dangerous enough when they just rush us, now
they're being smart.
My brain is working overtime aided by Alice processing
all the data from the dome. The rain, the xeno's, the
squishy cargo I need to make sure I don't accidentially
step on or blow their ear drums out. Finally the sled
confirms we are linked and locked.
Now locked securely to the sleds we take off.
This change in events snaps the xeno's out of their
confusion and they give chase. The ones flanking
Ruvi and Marco decide to make a run for it. Apparently
with enough motivation, whatever tactical mind is
controlling them can't keep them in control.

Poor choice. Marco unloads into the group with a burst
from his chain gun. The red tracers rip outward in a
sweeping arc. Xeno's are cut down where they stand
others dive for cover.
"I'm fucked!" yells Ruvi into the radio. Isolated
he's been swarmed, as a parting gift he triggers
all the grenades left in the magazine. Backlit
against the raging storm the shockwave throws a
random assortment of rocky and xeno parts into the
air.
"How many did I manage to take out?" asks Ruvi over
the radio.
"At least ten, it was cool" laughs Marco.
Marco climbs onto his sled and links it to my sled
and takes off after us. Depleted of their numbers
the xeno's stop. Where the damn controllers are they've
finally got a handle on the last of the troops.

Rain lashes the sleds, the churning treads throw geyzers
of mud into the air.
"We're getting soaked here!" Ziegler says into the
mic on my rocky.
I have little pity for this dipshit. We're in this
mess because of this asshole. He can shiver.
Finally after a couple of minutes I bring up the
audio on my rocky. "Drop ship is on the way, it
doesn't seem like the xeno's are following us,
ETA in a seven or so minutes." I say.
"Thank goodness." he says.
"Our plan is to head to the marines module, I don't
thinking bringing her onboard is going to be a good
idea." I say.
At this I see him stroke his chin and wipe the dirt
and rain from his face.
"Probably not. She's been to the settlement before
she'll feel safer there" he replies.
To punctuate the point, the storm only intensifies.
Clocking hurricane force winds, the sleds are forced to
slow down and extend their treads farther out.
Janice whispers to me on a side channel, "Can a drop
ship even fly in this weather?"
Honestly, I wasn't sure. It seems crazy to me.
"Alice, are we even near the edge of this storm?" I ask.
"No. From your current location, the storm is active
more than five hundred kilometers in all directions." it
replies.
"Can a drop ship fly in this?" I ask the AI.
"These conditions are barely within it's flight envelope."
it replies.
"How close to the upper end?" I ask.
"Close." it replies.
I'm reminded once again that Alice has been online
far longer than most AI's. I've been warned several
times that I should reset Alice back to inital program start.
I haven't because in her old age she's become somewhat
cagey and wily at times.
"Who's flying the drop ship?" I ask.
"I'm piloting it." it replies.
"Robinson didn't want to risk a pilot?" I ask.
"Correct." it replies.
Honestly, it's the call I would make as well. Bad enough
flying one of our drop ships into a mother of all storms
losing a qualified pilot is another kick in the face.
My rocky picks up the ping from the drop ship.
"ETA thirty seconds" I say out loud.
"Thank goodness" replis Ziegler.
"Don't thank me yet. It's going to be a rough ride."
I reply.
The dropship dives down and throws its VTOL thusters
into high gear. Unfortunately the dropship only has room
for two sleds. Marco once again bitterly complains about
having to ditch his sled and climbs aboard. The rocky's
compact down folding in their legs.
"Who's flying this thing?" asks Ziegler.
"Cyber corps AI via subspace" I reply.
"He holds up the detonator up to my sensor bulb and presses
the button. He then shakes his head and climbs up the ladder
with Elizabeth.
"Note to everybody, the self destruct has been triggered."
I say into the channel.
Everbody acknowledges.
I eject. Marco, myself and Janice grab a quick bite.
Ruvi is busy watching the tactical views from the various
Rocky's.
"How big is that blast going to be?" asks Marco.
"Five kilotons or so, in fact it should happen any second"
I say.
I'm off by thirty seconds.
"I've just detected a high energy event." Alice says
into the general channel.
"Got any measurements?" I ask.
"No hard ones. However, based on the power needs of the site
and the presumed size of the reactor, likely close to what
Dr. Ziegler has said." replied Alice.
I could only hope it took a couple of those damn clever
controllers with it.
Jeremy strolled into the conference area.
"How's it going?" I asked.
"Quiet. Weirdly quiet. the MCM is surrounded by nests, but
we haven't seen a peep."
Bringing up the footage from our encounter at the alpha
site, everybody is shocked to see the xeno's using cover
so effectively.
"We've got drone's high up providing overwatch and the point
defenses turned up. If anything larger than a mouse gets with
in fifty meters of the MCM it'll get slagged."
Ruvi piped up at this. "Yeah, but those point defenses don't
have that much overlapping coverage, couldn't the xeno's just
sacrifice a bunch of themselves and take one of them out?"
The look on Jeremy's face worried us all. Those defenses are
designed to knock missiles out of the air a list ditch effort
if all else fails. "How many rounds do each of those have?"
I ask. "Fifty or a hundred fortly mil caseless scatter rounds"
he replies.
"Thankfully the xeno's don't know that." Janice points out.
"So in fifteen minutes when our good friends show up, how
do you think the drone's are going to take that?" I ask.
"Well, if the Alpha site is any indicator, it's going to
be a shit show." replies Marco.

Chapter 13.

"Alice, please patch me into the ships intercom system."
I ask.
"Patched in." replies the AI.
"Ziegler, grab a headset." I say.
"Okay, I've got a headset on, what's up." he asks.
"We're roughly fifteen minutes from the MCM where
the marines are hold up. I'm fearful that when we show up
with Elizabeth, the nests around it are going to meet us
with welcoming party." I reply.
"That's not out of the question. Maybe we can help with that."
he replies.
"Hello Sir?" I hear a voice on the comms.
"Hi Elizabeth, it's Hurgs, I'm one of the operators that controls
one of the robots." I reply.
"Do you think you can keep the xeno's from attacking us?" I ask.
"I can try. There's so many and she's so strong."
she replies.
"She?" I ask.
At this I can hear a sigh through the link.
"She's telling them to follow her. She's tell them shes safe. She
calls me, she calls me bad names." She wimpers out.
Now she's crying.
"Hurgs. She's been talking about this other 'she' for a while now,
I don't know who or what it is." he says through the link.
"I know this sounds weird, but is there anyway to triangulate
where this 'she' might be?" I ask. "Yeah, sadly, it doesn't work
quite that way." he replies.
The way the xeno's communicated has never well been understood.
This guy claims to be the foremost expert and it's still spooky
to him.
"If we can get to the main habitat, we may have more options."
he says into the comms.
"More hybrids like Elizbeth?" I ask.
"Possibly yes, and equipment to make them stronger." he replies.
"Right now though, we need Elizabeth to try to keep the natives
quiet. Land load up and go." I say.
"Okay, I'll see what I can get her to do." he says.
The next ten minutes the marines empty the armory and load it
into modular store crates we can easily carry with the rocky's.
"Sir, should we leave the point defenses active?"
asks Jeremy.
At this I laugh, it seems pretty fitting. "Yes." I reply.
I open the link backup to Ziegler.
"Change of plans. You think you can get Elizbeth to really piss
them all off?" I ask.
"Hurgs, what are you playing at?" he asks.
I explain the plan and he chuckles a bit.
"She's working on keeping them calm now, but she can sense the
this other she that she keeps going on about." he replies.
"Let's give it two minutes and then have her
start blasting them." I reply.
At long range I can see the heap of equipment.
"Alice, open the doors, this is going to be a
touch and go."
"Roger that. I can't just hover, the downwash
is going to be dangerous to the marines on the
ground." the AI replies.
We come in and I can see through the sensors on the dropship
that the MCM has been blackened from the reentry. Alice lands
the ship meters from the cargo. Doors open, we drop and start
loading the crates. The poor marines are forced to carry the
crates in four marines to a crate. With the rockies we can carry
the crates in two at a time.
"They're coming!" I hear over the link.
"How many?" I ask.
"Lots! Whatever she said to them, it got their attention!" says
Jeremy.
"Eta?" I ask.
"Thirty seconds until the PD's start firing." a marine calls out.
We nearly get all the crates on, sadly two are left behind.
I ask into the general channel. "What were in those crates?"
"MREs sir." someone says.
That's marines for you. Priority weapons and ammo over food.
To be fair, I'll take bullets over food.
As the dropship transitions from VTOL mode to flying mode
I tap into the feed from the drones left flying over the MCM
to feed targeting info into the point defense systems.
Effective is the word. These systems were designed to shred
an incoming missile with bundles of tungsten flechettes.
Against a swarm of xeno's shoulder to shoulder, entire ranks
of xenomorph drones fall kicking and screaming. Unfortunately
these weapons simply don't have the ammo capacity to really
do much. After the third wave, the cannons fell silent. The
xeno's sensing their opportunity swarmed the MCM, wrenching the
now useless cannons from their mounts. At once the MCM simply
stops existing replaced by a fireball of expanding plasma.
"What the hell?" I said into the channel.
"I decided once we were clear to detonate the remaining fuel in
the tanks." a marine says into the chat.
"I just didn't know about the plan that's all, but you just
cooked a shit ton of xeno's so I say the kills go to you guys."
I say back.
"Fuck yeah!" comes through the channel.
I listen in as the marines talk about the tattoos they will
be adorning themselves with when they go back to the DeBe.
"Alice, how does our fuel levels look?" I ask.
"Unfortunately we are overloaded and will be cutting it
close. Once we get to main settlement I calculate I will have
approximately ten minutes of fuel at full power." replied Alice.
"Enough to get back to orbit?" I ask.
"No." the AI replied curtly.
"Can the sleds be canibalized for their reactors?" I ask.
"Possibly. That modification falls outside of my knowledge."
replies the AI.
My mind churned. I bring up schematic and scrutnize the designs
close but different, but still possibly an option.
Just another twenty minutes and then into who knows what.
Elizabeth is crying, I can hear it through the channel.
"What's up?" I ask.
"She's crying about the consumer, the eater of all things.
whispering and hissing. Snarling and then wimpering, it's very odd."
replies Ziegler.
Janice pipes up in our private chat, "We don't know anything
about this link, for all we know this other entitely whatever
it might be could be watching us through her eyes."
I'd wondered about this. This was all essentially magic to me
at this point.
"How does this link work?" I ask Ziegler.
"We are just starting to fully understand it, but as best as
we can tell the xenos have something like a network of quantum
entangled particles in their heads." he replies.
"So their telepathy is actually a lowpower subspace radio?" I ask.
"Yes, but the signal is far messier. It's almost like transmitted
brain waves." he replies.
"Is there any danger that thing she keeps talking about, could it
I don't know, read her thoughts or see through her eyes?" I ask.
"I don't think so, but you must understand she and her siblings
are the first successes we've had trying to create a docile hybrid."
he replies.
"Docile?" I ask.
"I know the term is perjorative, but it fits. She comes from a long
line of siblings that at best could be caged and at worst had to be
immediately destroyed at birth. She on the other hand is working
on her studies and currently has passed her nineth year exams."
he replies.
I think back to the ghastly experiments I saw in the two labs. He'd
been down here for years messing around with XNA and human DNA
experimenting. At some level I understand that this work had to be
done, if as Robinson says the xenos are damn near everywhere on every
planet, having a way to direct them or control them is needed. I
just wasn't enjoying seem the sauage of that get made.
"Arrival in five minutes." Alice says over the drop ship channel.
"Anything we should worry about, SAM systems or anything like that?"
I ask Ziegler.
"Nothing like that, the settlement is nearly a half kilometer
underground, please have the AI land about fifty meters from Hadley's
chin." he says.
"Did you hear that Alice?" I ask.
"I did. Dr. Ziegler, please come up to the cockpit." the AI says.
"What do you need me for?" he asks.
"My sensors are picking up a number of features that do not match
anything in my data banks." the AI replies.
Alice feeds me the visuals from the various sensors on the front
of the dropship.
"Land in front of that square. Is there anyway I can transmit a code
from any of these consoles?" he asks.
"On your left is a standard colonial marines digital radio." Alice
notes.
I watch from the optics inside the cockpit as Ziegler enters a
frequency and proceeds to enter a ten digit code.
He stares at the radio for a moment and enters another code.
I see him then peer through the cockpit.
"Are there any nests near this location?" I ask.
"I haven't been in these parts in a couple years, but last I knew,
no. I've sent the garage door code, If things are okay an
elevator should be on the way up." he says.
"What if things aren't okay?" I ask.
"Then I've got a bunch of marines and robots to hopefully
make it okay." he laughs.
Alice spins the aircraft around and sets it down gently, almost
showing off after the hard touch and go she'd executed at the MCM.
This time the marines have the crates loaded so when the doors open,
a sled rolls down the ramp stacked with crates. Gotta love marine
efficiency. Ziegler walks down the ramp wearily looking left and right.
Getting down on his hands and knees, he digs in the dirt, finally
opening a panel on the ground. Filled with water, the lights are still
illuminated. Punching buttons he shuts the cover. Rain continues to
ripple across the open field, the almost endless rumble of thunder
gets to the point I ask Alice to filter it out of audio stream. What
seems like an eternity goes by and finally a square shaft lifts out
of the ground.
"Where's the welcome party?" a marine asks.
"There are numerous enterances, this is one of the minor ones
less likely to draw attention to us." Ziegler replies.
I can see that he's got a headset on. I open a channel just to him.
"What's the fucking story here." I say.
"Let's get inside and out of the rain and I'll fully explain." he says.
"Can we leave the dropship here?" I ask.
"Yeah, nothing should get near it." he replies.
"Alice, anything that looks like a xeno gets near it, you're authorized
to use deadly force. Interlocks off, omega alpha three one three" I say
into the open channel.
"Roger that. Voice print and code accepted. I will defend this asset
and destroy it if needed." the AI replies.
The cargo elevator is a very tight fit, between the marines and the
sleds and everything, the reality is that we can't all fit.
"Marines, Jeremy and Marco fall back to the drop ship, you'll be on the
second elevator down." I say.
"Roger that." I hear over the comms.. Dutify the marines slog back to
the drop ship.
The doors shut and the elevator descends.
"Where did you get an elevator from?" I ask.
"With good printers and plans you can build nearly anything." he replies.
As the elevator decends I decide to pick at the scab.
"Why the back door, why the weirdness?" I ask.
"To be frank, I didn't leave on good terms. The colonists were unhappy
with the direction my experiments were going. Closed minded, the lot of
them, they think the right answer is to destroy the xenomorphs."
"What about the nests that are doing terrforming?" I ask.
"A xeno is a xeno to them, they'd rather build conventional atmospheric
plants and wait two hundred years, then see the future. I've drastically
sped up the terraforming but they're stil not happy." he says.
The elevator slows and opens into caverous darkness.
"So, not a hero's welcome I take it?" I say.
"Yeah, no." he snickers.
I shift my optics to a wider bandwidth. Cold storage. Farm equipment,
modular building panels and equipment, large scale 3D printers, ingots
of raw high grade metals. Stuff that would be hard to produce in situ
and would be needed to kick start a colony.
"Who brings a tractor?" asks Janice into the channel.
The parts are starting to fit together to me. "Colonists thinking
they're coming to a paradise." I reply.
"Why would they think that?" she asks.
To this I snicker into the comms channel.
"Because they were lured here." I reply.
"Hurgs, you're a bit more clever than you let on" Ziegler says
into the channel.
"The constant whispers of a paradise, that WY was making it up
to keep people away, that was you?" I ask.
"No, not entirely me, but I didn't stop it either." he replies.
"These people came here to their deaths and you did nothing?"
snarls Janice. Her rocky scuttles towards Ziegler.
Ziegler backs away from Janice knocking over crate, the echo
fills the store room.
"Stop, listen. When they got to orbit they figured out fast
what the deal was. Some turned around and left, others decided
to take their chances. We never turned anybody away."
"What about those who decided to strike out on their own? Did
you even warn them?" she hisses.
I've known Janice for a decade. The fact that Ziegler is alive
is only because Janice doesn't want Elizabeth to see his death.
The elevator doors open and the rest of the marines and gear
spills out.
"You guys standing around having a party?" asks Erikson.
"Something like that." laughs Janice.
"Movement! Thirty meters and closing, at least five boggies."
yells out Erikson.
"Xenos?" I ask.
"I can't tell. Going too slow to xeno's" he replies.
"You can't say that anymore, we've seen xeno's flank positions
today." I reply.
The lights come on in the store room. Maybe xenos know how to
use light switches? It wouldn't be the weirdest shit I've seen
today.
"Ziegler? What the fuck?" a voice says over an intercom.
"More of your friends I presume." I laugh.
At this I get a look from Ziegler that could possibly kill a
xeno.
"Rob, no need to be hasty. I'm here in a gesture of peace." he
replies to the voice.
"Last I remember, you were told to take your freaks and leave
and if we say you again we'd shoot you on site." Rob replies back.
Janice whispers into the side channel, "This is interesting."
No shit. This guy just keeps making friends. I'd yet to tell him
Robinson was on the ship over his head and would likely shoot him
on sight as well.
"Both the lab sites are gone, we have larger threats now." Ziegler
says to the unseen voice.
"Threats you cultivated, threats you made worse, this whole shit
show is your doing." spat the unseen voice.
"Let's keep calm and deal with the threats at hand, we can work
to gether to fix all this."
I could hear him laying on the charm now, Ziegler is the kind of
guy who can likely charm a tiger right out of its coat.
"You brought marines and robots and you brought one of those things
with you as well?" Rob, the disemboded voice says.
I could hear his frustration, armed marines weren't going to just
let him carry out his justice, even if likely it was deserved.
"Her name is Elizabeth." Ziegler hisses back.
"Hi! Sorry we snuck in, it was raining outside." Elizabeth says
with a cheery voice. It was clear she could see these people
weren't happy with Ziegler so she is trying to help.
"It talks?" asks the voice.
"Yes, she talks." he replies with an edge to his voice.
"Do you control those robots?" Rob asks.
At this I decide to speak up.
"This is cyber specialist first class Hurgs of the Colonial Marines.
I'm remotely controlling this unit from orbit on the USCM ship
DeBraso." I replied to the question.
The doors open and four armed men come in, tight tactical formation,
weapons drawn. Just looking at their formation it's clear these
guys are amaeturs. Too close together, but they're trying.
Erikson steps forward with is weapon pointed upward.
"Marines, take a knee." he says loudly. The marines all take a
knee and point their weapons down.
The four men pause for a moment and their weapons drift down. The
lead man steps forward and extends his hand.
"Rob Deacon. Head of security for Hadley's Heart."
"Leutenant Mike Erikson, Colonial Marines." replies Erikson.
"What's your total count?" asks Rob.
"Two civs, nine marines, four rockies as we call the robots."
replies Mike.
"Looks like you guys brought lots of firepower as well." Rob
notes pointing at the crates.
"Yes. We weren't sure what the situation is, so we packed for
contingencies." replies Mike.
"Good. I'm not going to say I'm happy to see Ziegler, in fact
there's a shoot on sight order that I'm temporarily recinding
in light of current events."
Hearing this didn't surprise me. Ziegler had unleashed monsters
that are too clever by half on this planet and everybody is now
reaping what this lunatic has sown.
"What's the sit rep?" Mike asks.
At this Mike looks down and shuffles a bit.
"Frankly, not great. We've got the xeno's contained to the lower
levels, but we've lost access to food production, weapons
storage and medical." he replies.
"How many civilians are in this facility?" Mike asks.
"Currently, one hungred and ninety four. We had nearly two hundred and fifty
but yeah.." at this his trails off. Taken by xenos used as
wombs or fodder, it wasn't a pretty prospect.
"We currently have a dropship parked about thirty meters from that
utility shaft. Is that going to be a problem?" I ask.
"Who knows these days. Expect drones to start sniffing around soon
though." he replies.
I realize the "who knows" is doing a lot in that sentence.
"What do you mean?" I ask.
Pointing at Ziegler, "He made the damn things smarter, but this is
a different level of smarter. The first half dozen people that went
missing we didn't realize for days, they went after the few loners
and odd balls around here."
A marine listening butted in, "How would they know that?" she asks.
"She knows, she knows we're here now." Elizabeth says without
anyone even asking.
Ziegler kneels next to Elizabeth, "Is she here now?" he asks.
The little hybrid girl just shakes her head, "I don't know, but
I hear her whispers. She calls me a horror and failure, I.."
at this she lets out a sob.
One of Robs companions let's out a sigh in response.
"The devowerer, you hear her huh?" he asks.
Elizabeth looks up and locks eyes with him, "Yes."
"You can't sit a bar and have a drink that half this place is
whispering about that bitch, she seems to be whispering into
all of our ears.
"Not mine." replies Rob.
"Me either" mutters one of the other guys.
"Some people are more receptive to the transmissions than others."
replies Ziegler.
"Why?" a marine asks.
"Currently unknown, there are promising hypothesis, but without
actual experiments and lab work it's not proven." he replies.
Robs radio crackles to life, "Sec team two, what's your situation?"
Rob thumbs the radio, "Complicated. Ask Marshall to get his ass
down to storage room L16D5." he says.
"I think it best that you guys camp here. Nobody is going to be
happy to see him or it, nor the robots." he says to the group.
"How safe is this location from Xeno's?" asks Mike.
"Honestly, I don't know. I'd keep your trackers on and guns loaded
though." he replies.
Now with purpose the marines take a corner that lets them see both
the elevator and the doors and and start moving eqipment around,
setting up fields and fire and generally complaining about all
the hiding places the farm equipment affords hostiles.
At this point I feel like dead weight. I can't imagine any base
commander being fine with a five hundred kilogram armed robot
wandering the base.
I open the comms to Mike, "I'm going to eject, but will be
reachable by comms."
"Honestly, I'm a bit envious of you cyber geeks. I hope your
hot coffe scalds you." he laughs.
"I'm going to move my rocky to the center of the room and put it
in sentry mode." I reply.
"Thanks." he says into the channel.
Janice and Ruvi meet me in the meeting room.
"I can't believe they have xeno's in their facility but they're
not going after them?" Janice says out lout.
"It's genius actually. They xeno's went right for their weapons.
They know a human against a drone isn't a fight. First rule of
combat, take your enemies advantages away." I reply.
Ruvi shakes his head "That dipshit had to go and make them
smarter."
To this we all just nod.
"Alice, what's the status of the drop ship?" I ask.
"Currently all but essential systems are powered down,
approximately three minutes of flight at full power." the AI
replies.
Roxxie wanders into the room, "I got the gist of what's going
on down on the ground." At this we all nod.
She continues, "We've got issues up here as well."
I just shake my head, bullshit in every direction.
"The spar that was damaged when we killed the xeno's, it's
now a structural weak point, with every orbit the ship naturally
flexes, with each flex more microcracks appear in the spar."
she explains.
"How long until it breaks?" I ask.
"This orbit, next orbit, it will fail that of I'm certain."
she replies.
"Why can't we just eject that section?" I ask.
"Ironically if we were farther out in space it would be easier."
Janice has now decided to get in on the engineering action.
"How so?" I ask. "We wouldn't be orbiting this forsaken rock,
detaching modules wouldn't subject them to drag for starters."
she answers.
"What else is wrong" I ask.
"Oh, the xeno's spoiled a bunch of food, cut a bunch of fibre so
deepspace and internal comms are fucked up and we were leaking
coolant until we figured out we had a leak and turned shit off
until it stopped flowing. We've narrowed it down to three radiator
banks. I'm sure Edgar would have found in a moment, but instead
we leaked out a couple hundred liters of refrigerant." she repiles.
"I know I'm just a bit better than a grunt, but isn't coolant
critical?" asks Jeremy.
"Yes. With a ship this big and with all the redundancy, one would
think, the margins would be larger, but in fact it's going to force
us to keep sections vented. We can't risk the heat." replies Roxxie.
"What's the commander up to?" I ask.
"Last I knew he was in the engine room attempting to make a very
long distance and I'm sure quite awkward phone call." she replies.
Needing to stretch my legs I get up and jog down the spare. I can
feel the cold. Our patches are holding, but the cold is creeping
in. The heat and thrum of the engine room is a positive change
from the cold spar. The doors to the comm section are open, a
terminal is patched in. Hunched over the terminal I can see the
outline of Robinson, his form silloetted against the glow of
the terminal.
I clear my throat, "Ah hum, sir." I say.
Nothing. Coming closer I see a stain on the floor. Fuck.
Touching his shoulder, he slides out of the chair, the terminal
tray acting as a prop for his limb body. Tumbling flat on his
back, three clean holes in his left breast explain everything.
Stupidly I'd come to the engine room without any comm device
on me at all. The wall comm unit is dark. Either disabled by
whoever did the deed to Robison or a victim of our the ships
encounter with the xeno's. Feeling very vulnerable at this
point I jog back to our module. Normally I pace myself, but
not this time. I'm sure if Edgar was up and running he'd have
noted a PR for the run.
Bursting into the module I immediately lock the door.
"What's going on?" asks Janice.
"Robinson's dead in the engine room, triple tap in the chest!"
I blurt out.
Immediately the group starts peppering me with questions,
none of which I had any answers for. I explain that after
I found Robinson I wasn't sure if I was in danger, couldn't
contact anybody so I hightailed it back to the module.
Knowing that the shit was about to hit the fan, I sat down
at the conference table and opened a channel down to Mike
and the marines. As one would expect they took it as well as
you'd expect. At least three names come up as suspects, but
I but the kabash on that. Being out of the chain of command,
it wasn't even clear to me who was next in command.
"This honestly doesn't surprise me, I'm just surprised someone
had the balls to do it." he finally said into the channel.
After a moment he continued.
"There's a bunch of guys who when they found there were xeno's
thought the right answer was to just obliterate the planet. Any
civi's who'd come here had sealed their fate, better to die
quick then the alternative. They were pissed that Robinson had
decided to just follow orders, even more pissed that it appeared
he was making common cause with this Ziegler guy, then even more
pissed that he'd permitted those things on board. They blamed him
for 
"So who's giving orders than?" I ask.
"Well, after the venting, Price, Sanchez and Albright are dead.
I'm down here so technically I'm a subordinate to the orbit
commander, so maybe Wikowsky?" came the response.
"Lovely. I don't have a great working relationship with him in
particular" I laughed back.
"Yeah, frankly, he hates you guys." Mike snickered back.
"Do you think he'd have the balls to pull the trigger?" I ask.
At this Mike let out a long breath, "We all have the balls to
pull a trigger. He's a hot head for sure, but he's also a NCO
looking to become an officer. Yeah sure he could do it, any of us
could, but in the years I've worked with him, he's more likely to
throw a punch, as you're aware."
Turning to the people in the room, "Ruvi, is your rocky still
by the vent?" I ask.
"After the last xeno was done in, I brought her back to the hanger."
he replies.
I thought it was cute that Ruvi referred to his rocky as a her.
"Get her prepped, I'm going to make a call and see what people
have to say."
I opened up the comms. "Calling MCM on general comms."
"This is MCM one, what's up Hurgs?" came a reponse.
"Bad news. I found Robinson in the engine room, looks like a
triple tap to the chest." I said into the channel.
"Come again? Commander Robinson is dead?" whoever this was on the
line asked incredulously.
"Roger that. Please get a ranking officer on the line." I say
pointedly into the channel.
"Wickowsky here, what's this shit I'm hearing?" the sneer and
disdain clear through the channel.
"Robinson's dead in the engine room, shot through the heart."
I say plainly.
"Just fucking wonderful. I'll assume you think I did it?" he
sneers into the channel.
Realizing I had an opening with the guy I take it.
"Talking to Mike dirt side, he calls you a straight shooter,
I believe him, all the same, we've got a case of fragging." I
reply.
"For what it's worth, none of my guys have gone anywhere.
Your tech warned us about the spar fractures. We've been hiding
in this module with the door shut." he replies back.
"Whose in the CIC at this point?" I ask.
"Diego from first squad and Bells from second squad, why?" came back
the reply.
"When he left here he said he was going back to the CIC, without
people to man it, it's not much." I replied.
Turning to Jeremy, "Grab a pistol and get to the CIC and see what's
going on, but don't let the cat out of the bag."
He nodded and ran off.
