Chaper 1.


"Wake up pretty boy!" laughs a marine with a gentle slap to my face.

The cold air hits my bare legs like a wall. This is always the worst
part of waking out of hyper sleep.

Tugs and pulls rouse me out of my ethereal slumber asas various needles,
probes and sensors are pulled out.

I crack my eyes to blazing light.

"Jesus, could you turn the lights up even more?" I grunt back.

"Oh, now you're awake." laughs a voice. I know that voice. My brain is
starting to come back online. Corpsman something or other, it'll come
to me.

Dickenson is the corpsman. As they go, at least not a total asshole to
me. "Chow in twenty. Muster in an hour." replies Dickenson. Apparently
she's looked me over and decided to move on.

As my vision adjusts, I lift my head to a satisfying crack as my spine
decides it wants to stretch. I look down the line of hyper sleep
chambers. This half open, the other half closed. I mentally count,
even. No hyper sleep casualties.

The USN DeBrasco is the third ship of the modular gladiator class of
star ships and has the latest generation of everything, including the
next generation hyper sleep modules. I stagger over to my locker, my
muscles protesting with every step.

The black BDU is yet another way I'm a bit different from your standard
Colonial Space marine. The collar manages to perfectly rub against my
neck right were my neural shunt and the skin meet. I'm convinced the BDU
designers designed it this way. Yet another annoyance my brain registers.

"Waking up is always the worst" mumbles a voice next to me. I look
over and see Janice. A fellow cyber tech. The clothes are even more ill
fitting on her. Her petite size in stark contrast to everything designed
for large muscle bound marines. I notice she's donned a scarf around
her neck to deal with the collar chaffing issue.

Janice and I have a complicated thing going. She comes over and gives
me a hug. I hug back. Ah, no kiss, still complicated.

We wander down the line of lockers collecting the other four members of
our rag tag cyber tech gang. All to gether we head into the chow hall.

The chow hall of this ship is the usual. Polished metal, food you'd rather
not eat, created out of who knows what and the usual derisive sneers,
outright jeers and the occasional head shake. As usual, the marines have
left a table just for us. We get in line with the everybody else.

"Why the fuck did they send six of you?" I hear from behind me with
a poke.

I turn and looking down at me is a marine easily a foot taller and about
twice as wide.

"Fuck if I know. Why did they send so many marines?" I ask back.

At this the marines snickers, "Fuck if I know" he laughs back.

The eggs are in a cube, the bacon is fake, something is clearly wrong with
the food printer, my bread has actual layer shift lines. I shake my head,
despite all the improvements in star ships and hyper sleep chambers,
apparently the auto cook was low on their priorities.

I take my place in the center of the table, a spot left for me by
Janice. "Five to One" Marco mumbles. "They send thirty marines and six
cyber techs."

"More than that." replies Janice. "They only opened half the pods. It's
ten to one."

"Not quite. I looked at the roster, there's a bunch of scientists with us
as well. But Marco is right the did bring quite a few marines." I reply.

"Why so many?" Marco asks. He's asking me because I'm technically
considered the senior officer. Technically because the Space Marines
in their disdain basically excluded the cybernetics techs out of their
usual command chain. Cybernetics technician first class is all the rank
I'll ever get, unless I want to head off to "real" boot camp.

The fact we get to even call ourselves marines pisses off the regular
marines. All the rigger, all the physical training, all the crawling in
mud, zero g combat stuff they do, we don't. Instead it's lots of invasive
surgery for neural shunts, brain augmentation devices and lots and lots
of studying.

"Are they planning on going down?" asks Ruvi, yet another long standing
member of our cyber tech squad. All these questions I don't have answers
to. "I know only a tiny bit more than you guys do. I got roughly the
same orders you got, showed up to the same packaging facility and found
myself here." They know I know more, but realizing that I'm not going
to divulge more details in present company, everybody gets back to the
business of eating their slop. The other three members of the squad
having asked no questions were still in the shell shock phase of this
whole thing. I pat Jeremy on the shoulder. "How you handling your first
trip as a cyber so far?" I ask. "Better than I thought. Damn neural shunt
is itching like hell though." I get up and look at his neck. It's red as
hell. He was the only member of our team who was a former Colonial Marine,
in some ways it pisses the other marines off even more. "After muster,
go find Dickinson and have her look at that."  He simply nods. I know
hey won't. He'll suffer in silence.


Chapter 2.


We line up on our spot on the muster line.

The marines line up ramrod straight.

"Company at attention!" yells a sergeant.

"Attend hut!" the marines yell back, echoing through the cavernous
chamber. Our group manages to bellow out an "Attend hut" with the rest
of them. The sergeant walks the line. Stopping at Janice.

"Is that scarf regulation Ms. Allman?" snaps the sergeant.

"No sir." she replies.

"Loose it!" he replies, shaking his head and moving down the line.

At this a couple of marines snort.

A loose button, a couple BDU's not cuffed properly. He's a real stickler
for detail. "Ready Room one, on the double!" yells the sergeant. Now happy
that in the case of sudden depressurization of the hull or fire, at least
the forty odd people's corpses will look good or something like that.

Being last in line, the room had exactly thirty seats. We all know
our spot on the line and the number of seats is without accident. We
dutifully stand in the back. The usual mild hazing, the norm.

Seeing this, the sergeant snaps, "Get our techs some seats!"

At this a marine out loud jokes, "Why, all they do is sit anyway?"

"Stow it Wikowsky and now you're getting them seats!" the sergeant
barks back.

From a recess on the wall, additional flat pack desk chairs are unpacked
and handed out. Satisfied everybody is now seated, the CO strides in
and the sermon begins.

A wall screen starts up showing a planet of swirl of muddled oranges,
browns and whites. Below it are bold letters that read "LV426". Head
nods and fist bumps ripple through the Marines.

"Welcome back to the shit hole known as LV426. Also know as Acheron,
Hadley's Hope and a few other wilder names. As I know you've all read the
operation briefing, this is also the first planet where we encountered the
what is now know as the Xenomorph." A murmur moves through the room. A
couple marines shake their fists, a xenomorph head is tattooed on the
back of their hands.

"Our job here is to recon the planet to evaluate it for habitability and
additional threats. Even though the primary atmospheric processor that
was installed near the settlement was destroyed, the four additional
atmospheric processors have continued to function. Wayland has spend
big money on this planet and they've hired our outfit to ensure that
the previous tenants have left."

So, this is a corporate gig, it makes sense. Why abandon a perfectly
serviceable planet just because it had had a few pesky inhabitants?

At this a marines hand shot up, "Yes Corporal?"

"What if we find more hostiles?" the corporal asked.

"Recon first, hostile elimination if needed." replies the CO.

I knew this was coming. I'd been given a prior briefing explaining some
of the mission parameters.

The moment we came out of hyperspace, we began mapping the surface.

The screen changes to show the planet without the clouds.

A quick zoom in shows the crater where the primary atmospheric processor
and the settlement had been.

The other atmospheric processors are highlighted on the map.

As well as a red zone. "This is the location of the derelict alien
ship. It is known to contain xenomorph eggs. It is considered a no-go
zone. Our objectives are the processors. In particular processors two
and three that has gone off the grid."

The screen turns off.

"Cyber will be landing Rockies first, then if deemed needed,
marines." Hands slapped desks, general groans, more than a couple marines
looked back and gave us looks I'm sure their grandmothers would have
disapproved of.

Since the original events on LV426, the Xenomorph had become a cultural
boogie man for the Colonial Marines. More than a few marines in this group
sport Xenomorph tattoos and talk righteously of avenging their fallen
brothers. Here they are, at the place it had first gone down and the
prospect of unleashing hell on their enemies was being snatched from them.

Jeremy had told me that a big part of their training now consisted of
simulated combat with xenomorphs. Guys build tiny shrines depicting
their eventual victories over this foe. Xenomorph heads as trophies
are a popular thing to come out of the various printers. I wasn't
unsympathetic to their feelings or cause. Though to me, going nose to
nose with a predator that could at best kill me or at worst use me as a
womb for another xenomorph doesn't sound appealing at all. As far as I
am concerned, I'm more than happy to merely orbit the planet. Landing in
ankle deep mud and fighting monsters is a job for robots and these guys.

However, the events on LV426 had lead to me being here. After the
debacle, the military realized that threats like the xenomorphs weren't
going to be easily tackled by men and women in body armor. Two major
innovations happened that changed things in a big way. The first was
the subspace radio. This allowed for far faster comms across stellar
distances. Moreover, it took remote control and sensing to the next
level. The second innovation was the creation of neural shunt technology
that allows for the true blending of man and machine. Suddenly the
military was presented with the reality of having robots they could
control at great distances. You might be asking why even come on this
ship then? As the Astro techs have tried to explain some of the math, the
farther you are away, the lower the amount of bandwidth. Communicating
with Earth is now so slow it can be measured in bits per minute. As
this session dragged on and various training and maintenance tasks were
handed out a few marines groused more and more about not getting down to
the planet, I wondered why they'd even been thawed. A thought a couple
marines had expressed as well. Others took it in stride. Fine if they
weren't going to get down to the planet, they were going to be riding
our asses and looking at every pixel we fed back.

This whole thing was going to be hot garbage anyway you cut it.

Robinson strides out the ready room, ramrod straight with his admin
in tow.

"Deployment will be at 0700 tomorrow. Cybers prep for
drop. Dismissed!" barked the Sargent.

Walking back to "Candy land" as everybody called our module the grumbles
in the halls get louder.

Wikowsky pushes his way up to our group, stabbing a finger in my chest,
"All this bullshit so you weenies can shuffle around in your tin cans?"

I've been to this rodeo plenty of times. The trick was to show the guy
think you're in the same boat as him and then give him a carrot. "Look
man, I'm just following orders like the rest of you. If we find something,
you'll see it as well. The feeds will be going to everybody."

"The Mark I eyeball is all I need." he replied which brought a couple
"yeas" from the group that formed around us. I could sense the tension
in the area, this guy had a xenomorph tattoo on his forearm. "We have
chain of command for a reason. Talk to your CO, I've got orders."

Jeremy's hand catches Wikowsky's fist millimeters from my face, he then
spins into a jujitsu move that has Wikowsky pinned to the wall. Nose to
nose, Jeremy growles, "Stow it. We've got enough going on without your
bullshit as well." At this, Jeremy drops the lock and gave the guy a
good shove. We turn and walk away. "Keep walking" he yells.

After a couple more paces he finishes with "He's a traitor to the Corps
and you're not even fucking marines. Why they let you chicken shits on
this mission I'll never know."

Sadly, this isn't the first time I've dealt with this. I simply point
to the corner and say, "Tsk tsk, Cameras."

Realizing that like every part of the ship, this is being recorded,
he finally gets the hint, turns heel and stomps off.

"What a fucking hot head" quips Janice.

"Seriously. How did he get through the damn pysch eval?" jokes
Marco. Jeremy snickers, "You have no idea how low the standards truly
are."

Chapter 3.


0700 gives us nearly ten hours to do final load out on our rockies. The
real name is some word salad remotely operational cyber kenetic enabled
recon systems or some shit. Everybody just called them rockies in an
omage to the old film about a boxer and the rock'em sockem robots game
that someone had dutifly printed out and had affixed to the wall of the
prep room.

The other funnier name that went around was "killer mushrooms" due to
the large sensor dome that afforded the operator a 360 degree view of
their surroundings. On four articulated legs and with two powerful and
two smaller manipulator arms, they could damn near climb anything, cut
through anything and come home to talk about it. Covered in high tech
ceramic armor and hard points they could take a beating and also bring
a subsantial amount of firepower to a situation as well.

For this mission we'd also been issued "sleds." Drop vehicles
that contain their own power supplies and can carry a rocky great
distances as well as carry spares and additional ammo. Cradled in
their storage units, we looked at the load out manifests. "What the
fuck is this?" quips Jeremy.  I came over to look at his tablet. "Glue
dispensors?" pointing to the tablet. I took a deep breath, time for the
rest of the briefing. "Everybody take a seat." I said. "The marines got
told what they needed, we have secondary orders to capture a xenomorph
if possible. Hence the aformentioned glue dispensors."

"And then do what? Bring it on this ship? No fucking way." repied Janice.
"According to the brass they've got some magic resin to encased and
rendered them inert." I explained. "Jesus have mercy on us." mumbles Mike.
The last member of our group was a petite woman named Joanne, but went
by the handle Roxxie. "Roxxie, I've been quiet through all this. Feel
free to speak up." At this, she let out a sigh. "A missions a mission,
but this seems like a really bad one. I've read the files on what those
things are capable of. Acid for blood, super strong, immune to vaccum. Has
one even been captured to test this containment on?" We all know the
answer to that. Even one had been, we'd have been the last to be told
about it. "I know saying trust the system is clique here, but in this
case, we're going to have to roll with it." Everybody nods. We all know
the score. There were bigger things afoot here, we just weren't entirely
privy to all the details. "Look on the bright side, we've got lattitude
on our loadouts. Pack for a party!" Like kids in a candy store, they go
to work. Ammo drums are hosted into place, bolts tightened, connectors
checked. Over the next three hours drop details are fed to my tablet. Ruvi
pings me. "Do we even know the drop point?" he asks. In response,
I forward the entire intel packet to everybody on the team. "Sir, you
just gave me everything." replies Ruvi. "Yes. I've got that power and
I'm using it. Let's not go in with eyes half open. Two teams. Team 1 is
Myself, Marco and Janice. Team two is Ruvi, Roxxie and Jeremy."

I wanted to make sure there was someone senior on each team. Roxxie had
a cool head and was a solid respected leader in the group. More data
flows in. My team is going to investigate why atmospheric processor two
isn't calling home. Team two is going to investigate the third processor
plant. Everybody nods happy with this arrangement. "Let's get some rest,
0500 I expect everybody ready to enter their cradles and jack in."

Chapter 4.


Dinner is somewhat nicer than our wake up meal. Apparently a tech
somewhere had tinkered with the auto cook because I get something that
resembles an actual hamburger. Not ones to complain, we eat our soy
protein burgers, head back and hit the sack. We get the usual side eye
and head shakes but we're left unmolested otherwise.

Four thirty is damn early, anyway you cut it. The marines make you used
to it, but it's still rough. I get up, bang on doors and got assundry
mumbles. Roxxie and Ruvi appear to be rooming together, honestly, I not
surprised and I'm happy for them.

Janice strides out of her quarters, haptic suit on and ready to roll. The
two of us exchange knowing glances and Janice glances at Roxxie's door
and simply raises her eyebrows. I shrug back. Frankly, I was hoping for
a late night knock that didn't come.

As Janice and I are warming up our cradles, the other members stroll
in, hot coffee in hand and climb down into their cradles and start
the warm up procedures. For cybernetics technicians, jacking in has a
number of serious dangers. The most common to newer users is known as
transition shock. Your brain is quite happy with all the usual sensory
input and then you pull the rug out and give it different and additional
inputs. Our group at this point has been jacking in at the low end for
two years and at the high end like myself for nearly a decade. I slide
my head back into the cradle and feel the click of the interface to my
neural shunt. My head is now locked in place, the visor slides down
and I feel the various cinch points as the haptic suit pins me down.
"Initiate transition" I say. Immediately I'm dropped into darkness.
"Commander, unit number one is ready." I say "Thank you Alice" but
my lips don't move. I'm fully shunted in. Alice is the AI for our
group. We're encouraged to give them names and interact with them as
full team members.  There's so much data flowing in, without an AI
to help collate it, you'd quickly be overwhelmed. "Status check" I
say into the comms channel.  "Team 1 ready, team 2 ready." I get firm
replies. Good, everybody has jacked in without issue. I switch over to
the command channel.  "Cybertech teams  one and two ready." I say into
the channel.  "Roger that. Hold tight, we are adjusting our orbit for
optimal insertion."  a voice says back. Into the channel I've designated
"Team 1".  The operational CO speaks up. "Team 1, prepare for drop in
thirty seconds.  Team 2, drop in 45 seconds."

This part is a bit of a nothing burger for us. The sleds and our
rockies will either make it to the ground in one piece or they simply
drop another unit. We have six units, plus an additional six ready
to go and just as many in spares  that can be assembled. During this
time we access the various optical systems on the nadar side of the
ship. Janice pings me. "Glad we've got subspace on the rockys, it looks
like one hell of storm in the north."  I change my perspective and she
is right. While always harsh, the detonation of the primary processor
had thrown gigatons of dust into the atmosphere, helping to trap more
heat and ironically speeding up the terraforming process.  A wet and
rainy planet now with extra heat pumped into it, meant big storms.
"I wonder if the issue with unit three is water intrusion or a bolt of
lightning?"  remarked Marco into our group channel. Privately I hoped,
though these stations were built to be dropped from orbit and "just work."

Bingo, five by five, confirmation of soft landing. The petals of the
drop capsule unfold. The sleds treads lock down. All green. Already the
sensors on my rocky were registering a gust of 50km/h.

Alice shifts through the spectrums, nothing. Without needing any urging
we proceeded towards the processing plant. Fuck. The blast doors are
ajar, at least a half meter. "I was really hoping to find nobody home."
Janice whispered into the chat. "Me too." I whisper back.

I notice that Alice had already brought all the weapons online.  Alice and
I had been paired more than five years ago, it had gotten some intutition
about it and I appreciated it. "No damage to the doors" Alice notes. Maybe
just a mechanical screwup? Marco creeps forward, deploying his smaller
set of dexterous hands he manipulates the controls. The door grinds open
a couple more centimenters. "That's all I'm going to get, the mechanism
is seized or jammed, I can't tell from here." Not surprising, water
likely got into the track.

I move forward and look closer. I unlimbered my big arms. I attempted to
pry the doors, but they only start to deform. Time to ask to break stuff.
"Permission to cut into the blast doors?" I ask. "Granted. Breach the
doors and enter."  the CO orders.

My plasma torch makes quick work of the blast doors. Plates of durasteel
fall to the mud with a sizzle. All three of us stalk through the steaming
opening into the lower entry bay of atmospheric processor number 3.

"Fuck me." whispers Marco. Behind me I can see that the door mechanism is
gummed up with Alien excretion. Every wall surface and the ceiling are
caked with it. Frozen into the walls are various shapes, their chests
burst open, but so coated in excretion and decayed as to make them
unrecognizable. "Confirm hostiles" I said into the channel.
"Roger that. Team two confirms evidence of hostiles as well." comes through
on the command channel. "I don't understand, there's nothing on this
rock for them to eat or use as wombs?" Marco jestures at the wall.
"Eh, please don't say womb." replies Janice. I can feel her disgust in the
channel. The dangers of being jacked in, bits of emotion travel across
the link. "Sorry." replies Marco. "Get samples" comes through the
channel. "Roger." I bark back. A compartment in the front of my rocky
opens, I dutify scrap some of the alien excretions into the container,
It snaps shut. I can tell the fusion reactor is online, the vibration
is enough I can feel it through the haptic suit.

"Deploy recon drones" I order. Triangular drones lift off from the top
of each of our sensor stacks. "Marco, Up, Janice down, I'll take straight
ahead." I call out. This is for the benefit of the marines I know are
watching the feed. Alice controls the drones as they fly through the
facility. Dopplar pulses, wide band IR and optical scanners feed
information back to Alice and into my mind mapping out the facility
and comparing it to schematics. I locate the nearest network interface
and patch in. The fusion reactor is functioning but at lowered power.
Its heat exchangers have been compromised. This smells exactly like
the reports from the other facility.

"Contact." Janice announces into the channel. "Lower level, My drone
was swatted out of the air. I got four distincts entities moving."
"Xenomorphs?" I ask. "It happened fast sir, the drone was nailed
from above." A quick reply shows the drone be swatted by the dark, vaguely
biomechancial hand of a xeno. "Deploy another?" she asks. "Save them. They
know we're here. I bring the camera feeds up. Dozens of cameras and only
7 were operational? The operational ones have been encased, their feeds
useless. It seems the Xenomorphs intentionally covered them or destroyed
them, but why would they know or care? Yet another question to file
away. My drone returns. Nobody home on the ground level.

"Movement, upper level, and lower." Marco was right. I heard the tromping
of feet on steel treads from above. These remote processors weren't that
elaborate. Three levels, Just a fusion reactor, large vents to draw in
air, machinery to split out the bad stuff, add in the good stuff and
shoot the atmosphere out. No control room, just a single console, spare
parts storage and miles of pipe and cables.

A dozen drones spilled out of the stairway. Some were full size drones
we'd all seen in the archive footage, others were slightly smaller,
thinner, pale xenos with weirdly curved heads. Training fully kicks in,
I tracked and fired a three round burst through the closest drone.
Configured to burst in the chest cavity, the first drone blows in half
throwing green acidic blood and guts in every direction. Immediately
a stripe of optics goes out, Automatically the sensor rotates to put
the dark spot at the back. Janice nails one of the pale smaller
xenomorphs with the glue canister.  A thick mesh of adhesive has
entangled the chreature. Identicial to it's larger cousin, it struggles
and snarls as the glue sets. "Not sure how it would work against a big
one, but we bagged ourselves a mini." Marco our resident nerd about
all things xenomorph chimes in, "None of the intel I've ever seen has
shown one this small, or skinny." Small is realative. This creature is
still near two meters tall, just very thin and pale, with an oddly
shaped head. Drones keep stalking forward now unsure what to do with
these new foes. I order our team to back out of the processor. Acid
eating through some critical part of the cooling system of the fusion
reactor is definitely a "bad thing." I'm also keenly aware a 10mm
caseless HE round in the wrong spot will quickly end this mission.
The drones surge through the gap we'd cut in the door, only to be
shredded three strides out. The assault ends quickly. Alice has kept
a running count, eleven in total. Janice creeps back inside and
retrieves our prize. Marco is busy sampling the various fluids
leaking from the drones. "This ain't good" I hear over the channel.
"I've got a jar made out of their super material, it held the xeno
blood for about five minutes." Looking over I see him holding up the
jar, the bottom of it gone.

"Team one, return to dust off point with the specimen." At this Janice
opens a priviate channel. "This is bullshit. Marco just showed them that
their magic test jar couldn't stop their blood. Do you want to be on
the DeBe with that thing?" The honest answer was no.
"Command, this is Team 1 leader. Reporting that Marco's containment
vessel failed. Requesting sit eval on return of specimen to
DeBraso?"

"We are aware of the situation" came the reply. It was easy
to forget that all our video is being distributed across the ship into
various war rooms. Minutes go by as we wait. Privately in our channel
we muse about converstations being had on the bridge.

"Orders are as follows. Restrain specimen to Marco's sled. Investigate
transmitted grid location." Marco immediately goes to his sled and
unloads additional ammo canistors and a spare portable reactor.
Janice pipes up in our side channel, "What the fuck is the plan?"
"Dunno. Follow orders, go to the grid location." I said flatly.
We secure the Xeno to Marco's sled as it hisses and snaps at us.
As soon as the last tie down is cinched, it promptly trundles off
over the horizon. We stowed ourselves and the supplies onto the
remaining sleds. "That little one was weird, what was up with its head?"
asks Marco. Both Janice and I say nothing. This whole thing is weird
and getting weirder. The sleds grind through the mud leaving deep
furrows as they chug towards our next objective.
"Alice, please eject me." I said to the AI. Immediately my senses
reverted back to the usuals. I hit the eject button and the visor slids
back and I felt the neural shunt disengage. Janice and Marco stepped
up out of the pits as well. "Estimated travel time for the sleds is
two hours." I say. They nod. There were long term effects of the
neural shunts. Headaches being the most prominent one. I could feel
one brewing and in more than one way. I jogged slowly down one of
the central hab spars that ran the length of the ship. To get the
blood flowing and to get some answers. Soon I find myself at the
Combat Information Center (CIC) door. "Permission to Enter?"
I asked at the intercom. The door slid open. "Permission
granted." I got gruffly back. On the walls I could see the six views
from the rocky's as they roll over the terrain. A tech turns and
says over her shoulder, "Team three drop ship is nominal. ETA nine
minutes."

Wait what, I reeled a bit. Another team? We are the only cybers
on the ship? That can only mean one thing. Commander Robinson clears
his throat, "As you are well aware PFC Hurgs, we are the middle of a
mission. Other than streching your legs, why are you in my CIC?"
"Sir, I'm concerned about the failure of Marco's test vessel."
At this he simply shakes his head. "Son, you are well above your
paygrade here. That's not the only vessel we brought with us. We've
got the situation handled. Get back in your pit and get back to
the mission." I was then tossed out of the CIC.

This whole thing stinks. I deeply dislike being used as a cog in
a machine I didn't know what direction is traveling. I walk back
to candy land and it hits me. Dr. Jaggo. I climbed back into the pit,
but I didn't jack in. Instead I write up a quick note to one of the techs
back on Earth. IF anybody had been involved in the creation of the storage
vessels, it is Dr. Jaggo. Normally our paths wouldn't have crossed except
for that she'd been pulled into a project to outfit the rocky's with
composite armor to make the more resistant to the creatures wildly acidic
blood. She is the expert when it comes to the xenos blood. The message sat
in the send queue. Weird. I checked the logs. Subspace link offline? Yet
another weird thing. Janice and Marco were already jacked back in, I
follow suit.

What a rainy nasty planet. The storm we'd seen from orbit had spun off
a series of smaller storms and we are enjoying the benefits of one
of them. Winds lash the sleds. We tumbled through the various bands
looking for anything alive. Around us the ground is glowing with lichen
mats, the puddles teem with microbial life. "Weird wildlife" Marco
said into the channel to no one in particular.
"I don't understand how there were drones. There's supposed to be no
large life forms on this planet." replies Janice. It's true. This was
something that had bothered us and had become hotly debated while our
robots traversed the plant.  The xeno life cycle was well known.
"What was encased on the walls then?" I ask.
To that there's simply silence in the channel. We turn our attention
to the planet. The landscape is windswept and desolate. The planet is
beautiful in a primortial way. I can see how eventually with decades
of terraforming it will eventually be nice. Get some gmo grasses going,
calm down the atmosphere. I let the sensor data wash over me as muse
about this. This place could be a paradise one day, but that was far
in the future. It was Marco who saw it first. "What the fuck is that?"
he said into the channel.

I snapped out of my daydream about the planet and realized he was talking
about the Xenos. Marco's rocky springs from the sled and lands agile
like a cat. "Is that a pig?" asked Janice. Alice answers into the chat,
"Based on image analysis, yes." The three rocky's scan around this
pigs corpse. It's chest blown open in classic xenomorph form. "It's not
decayed much if not at all." I notice. "CIC, you seeing this?" I said
into the command channel. Over the channel I heard commander Robinson's
exhale. "We see it. This might change the number of hostiles." In our
private channel Marco muttered, "ya think!" Marco climbs back aboard
and we trundle on, however now all three of us fully extended our sensor
bulbs. Without prompting Marco launches an additional drones to provide a
larger swath of overwatch, yet again showing initiative.


Chapter 5.


"What an ugly hole in the ground." says Marco. Both Janice and I
acknowledge it in the channel, it was. Three meters high and seven
meters wide it went down at a steep angle. "Permission to launch a
drone into Hadley's asshole?" asks Marco. We both snicker, I hear
someone on the command channel snicker as well. "Any idea what might
be down there?" I ask. "Shitloads of drones, who knows what else. I'm
still boggling about that skinny pale one" Janice quips. "Permission
granted. We came to get intel, launch a drone." I order. You have give the
to xenos credit, they're at least consistant. Their architecture if
you could call it that, is very biomechanical. Down the center of the ceiling
a long spine protrudes, ribs a meter deep extend off this spine down the walls
to the floor. Weird spiny crenalations protrude from the walls all over the place.
Deep alcoves and blind corners fill this cave. The entrance descends fifty
meters and then opens into a low cavern, the air is so humid the downwash
from the drone is easily visible. Tunnels go off in eight different
directions. "I bet it stinks" Marco says.
"Can it. I'm liking this less and less." I say. "Pick a tunnel."

Marco flies the drone down the third tunnel. Seventy five meters
and another twenty meters deeper into the tunnel system we found our
first breeding room. "Oh shit." was all Marco says. "Oh god." Janice
whispers. Humans, or what was left of them pinned to walls. Some dead,
some alive their abdomens swollen. "How?" whispered Janice. "Free
booters." Marco says flatty into the channel. Wayland could try to kill it
whenever it came out on the nets, but the knowledge was out there. You
can't build five building size atmo processors, modular buildings,
train and recruit families and launch them without people talking. The
people who got left behind told stories of a paradise, of clean land and
water, blue skies. People want off the increasingly crowded polluted
Earth. There are stories of groups going off and landing on charted
planets without a charter and claiming them, I'd never seen proof,
until now. "Pull the drone out, pick another tunnel." I say flatly.
"We're just going to leave them?" snarls Janice. I felt her disgust.
I didn't like it either. "I promise we'll make sure they don't suffer."
I said into the channel.

The next tunnel we found another birthing chamber, but we find pigs
instead. It makes sense. Pigs, humans, dogs, livestock, the xenos didn't
realy give a shit. The four chamber is weirder though. Pig pens. Dozens of them.
Sows squealed at the drone. The sows had been glued down by the alien resin.
Something that looked like an adapted facehugger grips each sows head.
I could feel both Marco's and Janice's disgust through the neural link.
"They're breeding fucking pigs?" someone says into the various additional
channels that had linked into the common channel. "They're stupid animals,
how could they be breeding pigs?" some unamed marine asks in the channel.
I let out a breath. "Easy. They've been watching us." I say. At this, all the
channels go quiet. "We can't just leave those people." says Janice. She
is right. Marco has been busy going down additional tunnels. In the
sixth tunnel we found something weird, a pulsing mass from ceiling to
floor, the weird pale xenos crawling all over it.
"What the fuck is that?!?" marco says into the channel. "Permission to
engage?" asks Janice. "Permission granted." I said. Janice unlimbers her
rocky, but the drone had done it's work. Finally the doorman had noticed
someone knicking around in the lobby and had raised the alarm. The response
was staggering. Dozens of drones spill out of tunnels letting out ethereal
screams.

Marco's drone gets knocked out of the air, swatted effectively by a long
xeno hand. They seem pretty good at it actually. This was going to get
out of hand quick. "Destroy the entrance!" I order. Alice loads and fires a
trio of forty millimeter grenades at the roof of the tunnel. Large divits
are knocked from roof but it holds. Janice's rocky rips into the roof with
grenades and gun fire. "Damn, that's tough shit!" I growl and more grenades
rain into Hadley's asshole. Finally the roof gives out and bows more than
collapases, the enterance now resembles a pinched tube, drones squirm out
only to be cut down by a fusilade of gunfire. The pile of shattered xeno's
grow. "Prepare for dust off in thirty seconds." a voice from the CIC
comes through the command channel. The sleds extend up hard points. A heavy
lift carry all latches on lifting away our sleds.  Marco launchs a parting
trio of grenades into the left opening of the collapsed tunnel. The shockwave
blows xeno guts and body parts out the other side.
"Eat shit motherfuckers!" laughed Marco. In the channel we heard a hardy
"Yeah!"
"Standby for shockwave." the same person from the CIC calls out. We watch
the feeds as a shockwave eminates out from the site. I ping Janice on the
private channel. "I promised they wouldn't suffer." The DeBe launches another
railgun round into the site. Another shockwave ripples out. Accessing the
optics on the DeBe, a large depression has formed in that spot. We've
pulverized the whole site from orbit.


Chapter 6.


The briefing room is crowded. Any pretense about sitting or desks
has faded away. The marines simply nodded at us and let us move to the
front. Apparently we'd shown some metal down there. Commander Robinson
is standing at the wall screen, "As it stands now, we have an unknown
number of civvies on the planet to account for." A marine speaks up, "Sir,
they don't have a charter, we're not obligated." The commander shakes his
head. "Obligated no, but our mission is to secure this planet. We've got
evidence of xeno activity and of them doing weird shit down there. Teams
one and two splatted no less than sixty of the damn things and bagged
a live one." A tech walks to the front of the room. "Knowing we have
free booters on the planet, we changed the parameters of our surface
scans looking for anomolies." The screen changes to a view of the southern
hemisphere. "In this case, ground penetrating radar seems to be unable
to penetrate this small area. The map zooms in and an area of irregular
triangles highlighted. "Stealth mats?" I asked outloud. "We think so. The
computer had to wash the image a bunch of times. They did a really good
job breaking up regular shapes. We only found it because we had to
change the computers filters." "Any chance you nerds could find more
of those nests?" asked a Marine. "Yes in fact." with that the screen
changes to show dozens of similar openings on the surface. Themographics
showed the classic eight legged tunnel system. "Facehugger?" someone
asked. It did, the thermals made it look like a facehugger. The tech
speaks up, "Sir, that puts an enterance within five clicks of Team
three."
"Have they been made aware?" asked the commander.
"Yes. They've deployed sentries, they've contained the specimen and
will be blasting off within the hour." Contained the specimen. That
sounded like they were going to be bringing the damn thing on board.
"Permission to speak freely?" I asked. "Granted." replied the commander.
I took a deep breath, "We've just witnessed that the xenos' are smarter
than we thought. We should abandon our assumptions about them. Fine,
you want to dissect that one, I'm more than willing to task my rocky
to a science tech, on the surface, but not onboard." Other marines nod
their heads in agreement. The commander nods his head, "Once again your
concerns have been noted." "Cyber teams one and two are to be on standby
prep until further notice, dismissed." While I knew this was somewhat of a
punishment for speaking up, I was glad we were going to be just chilling
in the pit ready to drop in a moments notice. Our cradles were also far
better and accessing and consuming the petabytes of data that were flowing
through the systems. Team two had been as lucky as we had been. Their
processing station was also filled with drones, including the small pale
ones. The glue had been ineffective at stopping regular drones and it had
turned into a turkey shoot. Roxxie's rocky had been damaged by drones,
but still functional. Roxxie and Ruvi were in the prep area working on
her rocky. Janice and Marco were looking at the drone footage. I peeked
in and they were looking at the footage of the weird column. I checked
the message queue, still pending. "Alice, what's the current state of
our subspace transmitters?" "All Cyber command subspace transmitters are
online." it replies. Alice is firewalled into our systems. It doesn't know
much more than we do. Edgar is the AI that runs the ship. Unlike Alice,
it generally lacks personality. More of a glorified central operator,
all the ships data flows through it. I connected to Edgar.
Query: Status of subspace transmission link with Earth?
Result: Link currently offline due to hardware malfunction.
Query: Estimate of time to repair?
Result: Unknown hardware fault, time to repair unknown.
So we're cut off
from Earth.
Query: Current mission parameters? Result:
       1. Assess habitability of LV426.
       2. Capture and analyze any lifeforms found.
       3. Eliminate any hostile lifeforms.
I knew better than to assume there were just three mission parameters.
This was a military AI and therefore very cagey. It was telling me
the mission parameters I was authorized to see.

Query: How much food are we currently carrying?
Result: Based on current crew size, 645 days of regular rations.
We have literally tons of food on board. They expected us to possibly out here for
a long time.

Query: What is our current compliment of scientists on board.
Result: 14 scientific specialists are on board.
Query: How many are currently out of hyper sleep.
Result: 14.

Okay, so we have nearly as many scientists as we have soldiers,
not counting the the addtional squads we had on ice and they're all awake.
As a Cybertech, I was trained on a number of systems, including the maintence
of subspace radios. I decided to take a different tact.

Query: Nature of the hardware malfunction of subspace radio.
Result: Unable to communicate with communications module.
Query: Do I have clearance to inspect the hardware?

I knew based on the pause I knew someone in the CIC was likely having
a "WTF?" moment as the ships AI asked them if some cyber tech could go
fishing around in the comms space. At this my ear buzzed.
"Cybertech first class Hurgs. Why is Edgar asking us if it's okay if you
go poking around in the comms room?" came a voice I didn't recognize over
the comm linke. "Sir, I'm a qualified subspace tech, I noticed our link
to Earth is offline." I replied. "We've got people working on it, if we
need help, we'll let you know. Request denied." the voice replied and
disconnected. I'm really making friends on this cruise I laughed to myself.
Alarms go off and our boards light up. "Team 1 deploy in 30 seconds. Bio
Science teams is in trouble."


Chapter 7.

Once we were out of the blinding plasma of the atmosphere we turned on the
external optical sensors. It is a proper shitshow. The Cheyenne dropship
is covered in drones. I checked the drop pods tragectory, I adjust it
to get us closer to the ship and put it into a steep ballistic dive. I
could see gun fire rippling out from the drop ship. Of the sentries
deployed only two remained. Alice brought up the ammo counters, they were
ripping through ammo and would be out in moments. Wham, the retros fired,
at least three xenos are boiled alive, good. The petals dropped from
the drop pod and they were on us in all directions. The chin mounted gun
fired near its cyclic rate. The driving rain helps to cool the barrel,
but only slightly. We'd landed in a triangular formation front of and aft
of each wing of the drop ship creating 120 degree overlapping fields of fire.
Marco sweeps the xenos off the dropship, it's engines cycling up.
"Dust off in 15 seconds, thanks for backing us up!" The pilots voice comes
through the comms. As the ship rockets upward, a howl goes through the xenos.
"Freaky shit" was all Marco go out. We held out for another ten minutes until our ammo
runs out. backed against each other, molecularly sharp cutting blades
extended and we slash outwards catching a xeno here and there, but
they stay out of reach. They'd seen us before and now knew we were a
dangerous foe. At last they all rushed us. The last images before the
feed cut out was of the my heavy cutting arms snipping through the head
of a xeno as it's claws dug into the sensor dome. At least I knew I'd
killed that asshole. We knew dropping like this was a suicide mission.
This is why we were in mechs anyway. Climbing out of the pit,
"That was a shit pile." I laugh.
"We accomplished the mission at least." replied Janice. "Yeah,
we helped them bring xeno aboard, honestly, I'd have been okay with
that one failing." repies Marco.
I checked in with command. They'd lost three of the eight techs they'd
sent down. I could only hope they'd been killed. There were fates worse
than death on this forsaken rock. I tasked Alice with looking through
the footage. Only two of the three techs were accounted for. I report
my findings and make sure the team knew as well. Janice blows out a
long breath, shakes her head and walks out of the pit.


Chapter 8.


The next two weeks are stark and grinding. Now that the observation techs
knew what to look for, we kept going after nests. The first couple dozen
we landed and explored. We found the same horrors. Pigs and humans used
as breeding stock. More of the weird pale xenos. Occasionally a queen,
who to humans would have been a real foe was simply an slightly harder
xeno to kill. We eventually gave up even exploring the nests that didn't
look interesting and simply hit them from orbit with railgun rounds.
The observation techs looked at the data and discovered more free booter
camps. Always torn to pieces. Finally we found a free booters settlement
that seemed to be intact. Dug deep into a mountain, they'd found the
right magic to keep the xenos at bay.. literally hundreds of meter of
extremely dense rock. The bored and by now cranky marines were mustered
to land. This was what they'd been waiting for. They were going to save
the civvies! Since finding the settlement all manner of comm attempts had
been made. Short band, wide band, laser wide and tight beam. All to no
avail. Two smaller nests were found a near the mountain. We dropped on
the two nests, this was the usual 'smash and stomp' as we had taken to
calling them. These nests lacked the pig pens and breeding chambers.
We'd found several of these 'Bunk houses' as we started calling them. Frankly, it
was always nice to just have to deal with angry hostile drones. Janice
found the first weird thing. A heavily reinforced blast door in the
back wall of the fartest chamber of the nest. Team two reported a
similar thing. Optics were above both doors, our sensors showed them
active. "Someone is watching us, that's for sure." said Marco.

Alice spoke up in the channel. "I'm detecting a low power radio signal."
"Whoever or whatever you are, you are trespassing. Return to your ship, do
not return." "This is Roger Hurgs of the Colonial Marines Cyber corps
attempting to make contact with the free booters on planet LV426."
"Cyber corps? We take offense to the term free booters. Nothing is
free on this planet. We are settlers, fair and square." Here I am hundreds
of light years from Earth and I'm dealing with a pedantist.
"Apologies, settler. Mightly hostile in these parts, we're concerned
for your safety."
"We are safe and sound. Leave Acheron and return to your ship and leave
this system." Caging and to the point. I had to admire the type
of people who were capable of battling the xenos and building themselves
a fortress. It was at this point the xenos attacked in force. Dozens
of drones came streaming into the chamber. We cut them down until our
ammo ran low, finishing the last of them with molyblades. At last we
were knee deep in xenos. The occasional head hissing and snapping at
our robotic ankles. Even with the resistant ceramic plates all of our
machines began complaining. We retreated from the dorm hive and parked
our units on the sleds. I jacked out to find commander Robinson standing
in the pit with him one of the technicans from the science part of the
ship. Erikson something or other. "This shit just keeps getting worse." he
started. This was just the way the conversations went with him. I took
a deep breath. No hello's, no formalities, just right into it. "The
techs have been examining that weird pale xeno Janice bagged. It's
been altered." "Altered?" Janice had now jacked out as well. At this,
the tech perked up, "Yeah. It has all the hallmarks of being tinkered
with by humans." he replied. Now I was interested. "In what ways?" I
asked. "That we're still trying to figure out. Definitely smarter, not
nearly as strong." the tech replied. "Smarter? I hope we can keep it
contained." I noted. I knew I was poking a sore spot and Robinson frowned
at me for it. I nodded towards our ready room. "I need coffee." All the
time jacked in had turned my on again off again headache into a grinding
companion. We sat around our break table. I explained the weird hive and
the re-enforced door and the voice. The tech pulled out a tablet and
tabbed through a few screens. "Something been bothering the geo guys
since we got here. The planet is far more along than they expected,
but they couldn't figure out the source." He connected his tablet to
our wall screen and showed the projected graph of where the terraforming
should be. The graph lines were at least double that. "Our intel said the
first plant blowing up accounted of it." I replied. "Yeah, the heating,
but not the gases. Nitrogen, oxygen and a bunch of other gases are
much higher. "Any chance you guys are collecting data on gas plums?" I
asked. The tech tinkered with the pad. "Can you overlay that with the
nest locations?" I asked. Janice and Marco got up and walked over to the
wall screen as the two maps lined up. "Holy fuck." marco said. Commander
Robinson got up and looked at the screen, "So the Xeno's have gotten
into the terraforming busines?" Janice snapped her fingers, "Those weird
colomns. They've got to their version of atmospheric processors." This
brought up so many questions. The Xenos were perfectly happy with the
planet the way it was. I had more questions to ask. I jacked in and
waded down back into the tunnel. I opened up the comm channel, "You
modified the xenos and got them processing the atmosphere?"

A couple of minutes go by. "Yes, we modified them. Considering it an
in-situ use of resources. Fully sanctioned by Wayland I might add. Hence
why we aren't free booters, we've got a charter, allbeit a classifed one.
This explained some things and posed more questions.
"Check with your higher ups, the project is known as X1243."
This tidbit of knowledege was good to know. "We'd appreciate if you'd
stop railgunning the installations and let the controllers rebuild and
create additional nests." the voice said. "I'm not in command, but now
that we have a fully understanding of the situation, I can talk to those
in command." I repied. "Good luck with that." the voice laughed over
the comms. "I never asked who I was speaking with" I asked. "No you didn't
and I won't be saying my name on this open line in any case." the voice
replied. "Well, you'd best clear out. I've sent a message to the controllers
xenos to clean up this mess." "How do you communicate with them?" I asked.
The comm channel closed. The last question left unanswered. I left the
tunnel and returned to the sled. "Heads up, there's a large contingent of
drones and what are now known as controller xenos convering on this
location. Request extract." I said into the command channel. "Acknowledged.
We listened in, a carry all is already en route." came the reply. Over
the horizon I saw two odd things. A mass of drones and above them the carry
all. A spindley contraption designed by WY to be compact and simple. The sled
extended it's carry lugs and the carry all latched on and carried me way
from the aliens. A half dozen of the controller xenos looked up as the
drones streamed into the tunnel. I'm not going to say I saw intelligence,
but for a moment I swear I saw the classic head shake of disgust.


Chapter 9.


"External Ejection Triggered" pops up and fades as I found myself nose
to nose with commander Robinson in my alcove.

"We have a serious fucking problem now." starting his conversations in
his usual manner.

"How so?" I ask.

"Edgar heard that transmission and it's triggered some type of fail
safe. We're locked out of all the major systems."

I thanked my lucky stars our systems were firewalled off from the rest
of the ships.

"Alice, are you still online?" I asked aloud.

"Affirmative. However, I have lost access to all ship systems." it
replies.

"I take it you haven't heard of Project X1243?" I asked.

"I have, but it was thought a failure." he replies. Janice, Roxxie and
Ruvi pop their heads up.

"Sir, now might be time to put our cards on the table." I point out. He
climbs out of the pit and pours himself a cup of coffee and sits down
with a huff and waved us all over.

"Everybody raise your right hands and solely swear that the information
you're about to told is to be kept strictly confidential. You will take
this information to your graves."

In unison we all said, "We solely swear."

"Sit down." he says, and we do.

"It's not widely know, but we've found the damn xenos on lots of
planets. Our grasp of bioengineering is good enough to know they were
engineered by some other species. Used as a type of forward force to prep
a planet. On many planets we've found eggs, just sitting there waiting
dormant, on other planets entire civilizations destroyed, only swarms
of drones left." he starts.

We all take this in. We'd all been exposed to the "Brighter
futures!" propaganda. Colonizing the stars kept looking grimmer by
the second.

He continues. "Wayland Yutani bio-engineers started tinkering with the
xeno's. The XNA that the xenos possess is remarkably malleable. Various
research teams came up with proposals to harness this malleability. We
figured if we can't out right destroy them, we'd co-op them. Once such
project was X1243. The idea was to turn the xenos into a controllable
labor force. Given wide latitude, the usual ethical standards were
applied."

This brings a snicker from everybody. WY is well known to place
the success of a project over the lives of people, especially low
level specialists. "It would appear this project has had some limited
success." he finishes. "I wonder what Edgar's orders were?" asks Roxxie.

Robinson rugs his chin "That I know. Upon entering orbit, it was to
try to make contact with the scientists involved with the project.
However, at last check they weren't even listening on subspace.
Our take from that was when they made planetfall they'd simply been
swarmed and destroyed."

I thought about the three simpler orders that Edgar had shown me. I
wondered what the "simple" orders the commander had been shown and what
the fuller set of orders actually were.

This is the dangers of a cagey military AIs that had their agendas set
by who knows who and given authority to accomplish those agendas.

Robinson went to the door but the access light stayed red. He waved his
hand a couple more times growing more frustrated. Finally he turns to
us. "Can somebody run a bypass on this damn door so I can get back to
the CIC?" he stammered.

Marco steps up and put his hand on the door.

"Sir, I believe opening this door would be a bad idea." he replies. "Why
do you think that?" the commander asks.

"Sir, the door is ice cold. I believe this habitat spar has been
vented." he replied.

It made sense from a tactical point of view. The last thing as a computer
you need is humans running around mucking with stuff.

"Marco, isolate the door controls" I reply.

He nods, opens the panel next to the door and starts
tinkering. "Alice, outside of our isolated pod do you have any data?" I
asked. "No. I'm cut off from all our external data feeds originating
from the Edgar. I'm only getting data from automated systems." Alice replies.

The DeBe despite it's impressive bulk was actually just a serious of
stacked modules connected to four redundant load bearing spars that ran
the length of the ship. Two klicks long with hard points every fifty
meters for various modules. Modules could be isolated, disconnected or
jettisoned. Most modules contained some level of internal redundancy.

"Alice, are any of our external sensors effected?" I asked.

"No. All sensors and comms systems on our module are operational."

Edgar had us on basic rations. Basically air, water and power.

"Alice, using our sensors, can you assess the state of the ship?" I
asked. A couple moments passed as Alice processes the data.

"At present the DeBraso is configured as designated in the initial
manifest." My fears that Edgar had simply dumped the modules overboard,
I'm glad that it hadn't.

"What do you think your marines are up to?" asked Ruvi.

"Regaining access to the ship I would imagine." replied the commander. The
marine combat modules (MCM's) were very robust. Ships in their own right,
they could be detach and be left in orbit if needed. I envisioned them
donning vac suits and using their airlocks to escape their module.

"Sir, do they know where your current location is?" I asked. "Likely
no. They'll head for the CIC first." he replied. Alice spoke up, "I
haven't picked up any transmissions on tactical channels." The commander
spoke aloud, "I doubt you would. I suspect when the doors slammed shut
they assumed Edgar went bug nuts and they're talking on a tether or
tight beam."

Jeremy added to the conversation. He was the only member of our team
who'd started as a marine and moved over to the Cyber team. "It's only
been twenty minutes. I figure a couple minutes for them to figure what's
going on, five to don vac suits, five to get to the edge of their module,
their module is to port side and there are four hundred meters of storage
between us and their air lock. I could shuffle okay with mag boots,
they're probably better, I figure they'll be by our airlock in another
fifteen or so minutes."

The commander nods along to this, "Probably fifteen or less. These
guys just got done doing zero-g drills the other day."

Jeremy nods back. "I'll grab a light and head to the airlock and
keep an eye out." At this he trots off at double speed.

The commander snickers, "Real shame he decided to become a geek." To
this the team all looked at each other and then back at the commander,
it was clear he'd hit a nerve and realized it.

He blew his cheeks out in his classic fashion, "He was a good marine,
it just seemed and odd choice."

Ruvi cleared his throat, "Sir, he is a marine, as are we." To this the
commander nodded. "I appreciate the training and hardwork you people
put in, it's just outside of our standards."

I could see this entire converation going off the rails.

"I definitely think this conversation is important, but right now let's
focus on the problems at hand."

Robinson could see I was saving his bacon a bit and picked up on the
theme. "What are your current capabilites?" he asked.

We detailed our current load out and equipment on the ground as well as
options for deploying our additional rockies shipside.

Jeremy came jogging into the room with six marines in tow, helmets
under arms.

"Sir, I found these guys on our doorstep." replied Jeremy.

The commander turned to the marines. "Status report."

The lead marine started in, "Both habitable spars are vented to
space. Three guys are MIA, presumed lost. The CIC was also vented, you
were assumed lost with the other people in the CIC. Glad to see you're
alive. Both marine combat modulars are intacted. We've disabled the door
controls to Edgar won't try to vent us."

"Status of the other MCM module?" the commander asks. "Locked down as
well. No word from those guys though our first priority was the CIC until
we saw Jeremy flashing a light at us. Another weird thing you should know,
one of the storage modules as extended large antennae. We didn't
get near them. None of us knew what they were for."

More secret squirrel bullshit was what it sounded like to me. "Roxxie,
please investigate those antennas." I said. She nodded and headed towards
the pit. "Alice, please put Roxxie's feeds up on the main wall." I
said. "Roger that." replied Alice. In short order we got a view of
Roxxie crabbing a rocky across the surface of the ship.

Sure enough from one of the storage modules long spindly antenna had
extended out several hundred meters. "Alice, identify." I asked aloud.
"Unknown, does not fit any known antenna configuration." replied the AI.
Janice speaks up at this, "More project X1243 stuff I'd bet." I agreed
on this part, there were more moving parts to this and I found myself
with five cyber jockies, a handful of marines, a commanding officer
and a tech nerd.

The commander speaks up at this point to the marines,
"Establish contact with the other MCM. Use tethers, who knows what t
hose those antenna can pick up. See if you can get to the CIC and
reestablish control of this ship." At that Jeremy hustles them back
to the airlock.

Reestablish control of the ship meant crippling Edgar.
"Sir, was the subspace radio to earth ever brought back online?" I ask.
"No son, I suspect without this, not much got fixed." he laughs and pulls
out a credit card sized module from his pocket.
Magnetically Intertwined Confined Particle. There's a couple different
acrnoyms for them. In subspace school we called them MICP's or Mikey's.
Everybody here just calls them PIPs. I'm sure there's some other backronyms
for it as well but it was why the deep space radio wasn't working.
"I pulled it when we came out of transit." he quipped.
"Why?" I asked.
"Do you like having every one of your orders countermanded, debated,
looked over, argued over from hundreds of light years away?" he asked.
I could see his frustration, but I also knew this was an excuse.
Janice spoke up, "Fine, we put that in one of our subspace radios and call home."
I shook my head, "It doesn't work that way. It comes down to how many hawkings
you can generate and create the tunnel. Our systems barely create a hundredth
of a hawking, the DeBe's deep space transmitter generates a field in the hundreds."
Jeremy spoke up, "Okay then, we put on vac suits and go install it." I laugh,
"Ironically if we could tell Edgar we have this, he'll probably let us
install it."
The commander scoffs, "He'd probably then lock the doors
in the engine section and cook us."
I couldn't disagree with that logic.
Then the alarms start sounding.


Chapter 10.


Alice went to full volume on all channels, "General breach alarm
detected in science module."
Janice throws her hands up, "How am I not surprised!"
"Stow it." I say. "Roxxie, can you see anything outside?" I ask.
"Yes. The marines just returned to the port side MCM. Sir, the
starboard MCM just detached and is tumbling." "Alice, any danger
to us?" I ask. "No. Based on current trajectory, the module will
enter the atmosphere in approximately two hours, eight minutes." The
AI replies. "Alice, any more alerts?" I ask. Alice pipes back in,
"No. Just the repeating breach alarm." "Roxxie can you see any of the
air locks?" I ask. "Sir, its tumble is slow, I can see if the airlocks
are intact." she replies. "That doesn't look like a very controlled
detach." I point out. "No. I wouldn't expect Marines to do that. They've
got plenty of firepower, I'd expect them to deal with the xeno." replies
the commander. "Sir, I've got a visual on airlock number one." Roxxie
calls out. On the screen we could see the airlock and what clearly
is blood splattered on the inside. "Maybe they ditched to isolate the
xeno?" Jeremy asks. At this the tech spoke up, "Possibly. That doesn't
account for the other xeno material." We stop and looked at the tech. He
turns and looks at the commander who nods. "After you cleared out the
processing plant we found several intact eggs. We encased them and were
brought onboard with the xeno." Marc lets out a slow and exaggerated
"Fuck." I don't disagree with that sentiment. "How many is several?" I
ask. "Four." the tech replies. "Hopefully encased in something stronger
that first container." Marco quips. "Yes. A resin embedded with micro
particles of a strong base to neutralize the xenos acid." the tech
replies. I could see the team mulling this over. "This material was
tested?" asks Marco. The tech shrugs, "I was told it would hold them." "We
need to get into that module and assess the situation." I order. Robinson
could see that I am starting to take charge and wants to make sure he was
still the top dog. Nodding along, "This module is your show, I'm going to
get over into the other MCM and see what I can do from there. Use your
rockies to investigate that science module and relay the information to
our MCM via the tether." "What about the other MCM?" asks Janice. "It's
got power, while the tumble is uncontrolleed once atmospheric drag
starts automatic systems will engage, it'll land of it's own accord. I
need to worry about the here and now. Figure out what's going on in
that science module." Roxxie spoke up, "Sir, permission to proceed to
the science module and breech if needed?" I look at the commander, he
nods. "Permission granted." I say. Despite the commanders talk of heading
over to the other MCM, he sats down and watchs Roxxie's feed. In that
moment I think he realizes likely the safest spot to be is here. Crawling
on the nadar side of the ship she mades her way to the science section
external hard point and airlock. Extending her smaller dexterous hands
she manipulates the controls, when that failed she override the controls
and entered the airlock closing the external door behind her. Carefully
she opens the inner door, to cavernous darkness. Immediately shifting
to infrared she launches a drone. The science module is a mess. Drawers
ripped open, lab equipment strewn across counters and floor. It looks like
it had been and ugly fight. The tech who I now knew as Eric quietly says,
"The eggs are stored in the room to your right." Roxxie extended one of
her larger manipulator arms and opens the door a crack to allow the drone
in. The drone does a juke and slipped through the crack. Against the far
wall four isolation chambers are lit by a blue lights. The four containers
smashed, the eggs open, the petal peeled back, their horrifying contents
missing. "You getting this?" asked Roxxie. "Five by five." I replied. "So
much for your fucking wonder material" huffs Marco. Roxxie opens the door
and the drone flies out, laser and doppler mapping as it goes. Roxxie
moves her rocky deeper into the science module. "How many people were
in this module?" she asks. "Fourteen" I reply. Across the hall the
holding cell was open, the pale xeno missing. "No signs it forced its way
out." Roxxie notes. Alice speaks up, "MCM 2 has reoriented and is firing
retros for re-entry. I've plotted its approximate landing site." "Let
us known when it's landed." I replied. Deeper into the science module,
the xeno had converted a meeting room into a hatchery. Four people are
cocooned against the wall. All dead, their chests burst open.

Seeing this Eric let out a moan, "No." and begins to weep. The floor is
littered with the remains of the other nine scientists. The recognition
software automatically counting bodies but unable to easily identify
them. They'd been consumed. Roxxie let out a sigh, "All accounted
for." Ruvi speaks up, "Where are the xenos then?" he asks quietly. It
is a question we are all wondering.


Chapter 11.


Immediately Robinson gets on the tether to the MCM,
"Be advised there are possibly up to five xenos onboard. One pale and
likely four standard drones." A voice I know well, Wikowsky comes back.
"Roger that, motion trackers are deployed. We sent a fire team down
the main spar a half an hour ago to attempt to access the CIC and
disconnect Edgar. So far, no word. My only experience with somewhat
sentient AI's was Alice. The fact that a four man fire team had been
gone for half an hour and they weren't sending people out to look for
them made think it wasn't going too well. Edgar had already depressurized
the ship and apparently killed the crew in the CIC, I wondered idly
what Alice might do if the mission parameters were more important than
our lives.

Roxxie speaks up, "I've got something." We turned our attention back to
the feed. Roxxie's rocky is holding a bulkhead hatch with long tear marks
in it. "Looks like they decided to get into the utility spars."
These damn things are clever, I'd give them that. The utility spars run the length of the ship. Tubes
of durasteel full of hand holds, cables and pipes, not created for a
human to stroll down but for xenos who have a weird thing about climbing
around in tight spaces, it's perfect. Immediately my mind begins to work
and worry about the ingress points to this module. I speak up, "Roxxie,
see if you can get to the habitat spar and aid the other marines." "Roger
that. I'll keep you posted." comes a reply. I have three rockies on the
ground, one in the science lab and two more currently in the maintenance
bay as well as two more as assembled spares and enough parts to probably
get a couple more up and running. I looked at Ruvi, "Jack in and get your
rocky positioned in front of the panel to the utility access." I don't
even get a "yes sir" before Ruvi takes off for the pit to jack in. I can
see the look on the commanders face, he'd have chewed someone out for
such a lack of protocol. My module, my rules. The problem I have now is
a lack access to the cameras in the habitable spars. I know they were
depressurized but I didn't know what was going on. Alice breaks this
train of thought. "Sir, there's a radio call coming in on the surface
directed to you." "From who?" I asked. "Origin unknown, triangulated to
a surface transmitter six hundred and fifty meters from rocky one, the
message is repeating." Alice replies. "Play it" I say. Immediately the
room is filled with the voice I'd spoken to earlier. "This message is
for Hurgs. Please contact us on this frequency, ASAP." Alice then says,
"The message just repeats." "Alice, what is the current location of our
rockies in relation to the cave we were in earlier?" I ask. "Approximately
nine hundred and fifty meters." it replies. I'd been ejected as the
carry all had lifted off, I didn't actually know where my rocky was. I
drop into my cradle and initiate a fast jack as it's called. I find
myself on the sled on a low plateau, the storm in the north seems even
angrier than the last time I'd jacked in. Because of the fast jack, not
everything is fully synced up yet. Details are still filling in. Waves
of rain lash across the sensor bulb. Ironically this rocky literally
has everything, but lacks wipers, blowers or sonics to keep the rain
off. I bring the radio online and boost its power to the max. I also
configure the channels so that my audio will bounce into the meeting
room. "This is Hurgs responding." I watch as a timer ticks. Thirty
seconds elapse. "I repeat this is 1st class cyper specialist Hurgs." Then
I hear it, a faint crackle, then the power boosts up. "Hurgs, we hear
you. What have you guys done? The drones have gone crazy!" the voice says
faintly. "Sir, please explain." I say. "After our last message, I called
the controllers to clean up the the mess you made with your robots. Things
went normally, then suddenly the controllers stopped responding to
our commands. Drones attempted to breach our compounds. We've stayed
secure but we've lost contact with the beta site and the main habitat
site." In my ear I hear Janice on a side channel, "I don't think any
of this is a coincidence." I agree. The mentioning of project X1243,
the sudden sprouting of the antenna, the weird behavior of Edgar, the
drones, the controllers, the opened confinement cell and the smashed
eggs. "Okay. I'm about a klick away from the entrance to your tunnel,
do you need me to clean that tunnel out?" I ask. "No currently there
only a handful of drones and a single controller. Once they were unable
to breach our defenses the mass of them left." the voice replies. "We
found the location of the beta site, where is the location of your main
habitat compound?" At this there is a pause, I'm sure there are others in
the background likely not that excited to give away such a vital piece
of intel. To me, this pause seems crazy. I open a side channel to the
main room with the commander. "Robinson, should I let them know about
what's going on the Debe?" I ask. A pause at our end this time.. "No. We
don't know these people or their capabilities. I have no reason to trust
these people. This guy, who I should remind you hasn't told us his name,
said a magic word that managed to fuck us up and get more than a couple
marines killed." came the response. I had to grudgingly agree with the
commander. Shit truly had gone sideways once he said the project name. On
the other hand it looked like his goose was getting cooked as well. "Okay
Hurgs, the main habitat is about 250km north of this current location at
the base of a formation we call "Hadley's chin." Immediately Alice brings
up a topo map and it was clear why they called it that. A prominence of
rock, wide and square. "I see it on the topo map. There's serious storm
brewing though." I reply. "Yes. The queens crown we call it. A product
of the original detonation, the storm has been raging for a couple of
decades, we're now in the season when it really ramps up. Between it and
the xeon's it's why we ended up under ground. Hurgs, you asked before,
the names Zeigler." comes a reply. "Glad to finally put a name to the
voice, I'm going to investigate the beta site and we'll get people to
the habitat." I say. "Thanks. Keep me posted." he replies. At that the
comm channel goes dead. "Alice, please plot a course to the beta site,
let me know when rocky one is five hundred meters out." I say. "Roger
that. Course plotted. ETA nineteen minutes. My mind registered that was
fifty six point eight kilometers an hour. Gotta love implants. I eject
from the cradle, climb out of the pit and head back to the conference
room. "Zeigler, eh? Didn't expect to find that mother fucker on this
rock." laughs the commander. That's going to merit some explanation. I
grabbed a cup of coffee, a snack packet and pain meds. Fast jacking is a
sure fire way to end up in bed stunned if you do it too often. Already
I could feel the tightness in my temples and I have a slight tremor in
my left arm. The commander looked at my arm and then me. I simply shrug,
"Dangers of cybernetics." "So who is this Zeigler guy you seem so fond
of?" I ask. To this, the commander just laughs. "Oh Mike and I go way
back, you could say we haven't seen eye to eye about the xenomorphs since
day one." The prospect of story time brings people to the table. Seeing
that he had an audience, the commander sits back and folds his hands
across his chest. "Dr. Mike Ziegler is a brilliant scientist who
falls into the category of men too consumed with the could, they never
stop to ask if they should. To him, he sees the xenomorph and their
straightforward bio-engineering as an opportunity. He calls it a gift
from the gods. He's convinced he can tame the damn things, use them as
a labor force, communicate with them. I attended more than a half dozen
proposals where he spoke of using what they'd learned to create a whole
bestiary of creatures that can work in conditions we wouldn't even want
to send robots. Based on what you've reported, it appears he's had some
success, and based on his latest radio messages, as usual when dealing
with the xenomorph's invariably these scientists bite off more than they
can chew." at that he puts his hands on the table. Turning to me, he says
sternly, "This guy is a snake in the grass. Results driven to a level that
would make Wayland VP blush, he's shrewd and smart. To quote an old North
American thing that they used to say before they'd arrest you, everything
you say can and will be used against you. Think before you speak. Whatever
his charter was with project X1243, the only info I had was that we were
to make contact. The details were entirely lacking. I don't even know
how many people are here or where was his charter." I nod taking this
in. "So this scientist is some kinda of megalomanic loon who will stop at
nothing until he creates super xenos?" I laugh. Robinson just shakes his
head, "You've already seen the leader xeno's. He's already doing that,
who knows what other horrors he's cooked up." Janice who'd sat silent
spoke up, "I'd like to know how he's communicating with them." Alice
broke in, "The secondary MCM has made landfall successfully. On the
screen the location was plotted. It put it nearly fifty klicks from
the entry to the main habitat site." Marco quipped, "Geez, if anybody
is still alive in that module, the last twenty minutes must have
felt like a ride in an auto dryer." "Any comms from the module?" I ask
Alice. "No. Emergency beacon only. However, the module may be transmitting
on low power. I lack resources to evaluate that." came the reply. I turn
to Jeremy. "Prep your rocky to drop near that module." Jeremy replies
with a crisp "Yes Sir." and makes haste to the pit. The commander nods
approvingly. "What's your plan?" asked the commander. "That MCM is full
of weapons and hopefully functional marines. Worse case we can hand
out weapons to civvis, best case, we'll have functional marines and
we'll hand out weapons to civvis." "I'm hearing a lot of hope in that
plan." Robinson noted. That was the truth. If dozens and dozens of xenos
decide to storm your position, short of a tactical nuke, your options
run out quickly. But the MCM did have point defense weapons that could
easily shred a xeno. Hope is all I'm running on at this point. "Sir,
I've landed a hundred meters from the MCM. Landing struts deployed,
it looks functional." Jeremy's voice came over the comms. "Any sign of
marines?" asked Robinson. "Negative." replied Jeremy. On the main screen
Jeremy's rocky approaches the MCM. Pops and clicks as the module cools
aided by the driving rain flashing to steam as it touches the heat shields
on the module. Approaching the main airlock, it was apparent there had
been a hell of a fight inside. Jeremy punches an override code into the
airlock and both doors open. Out of the airlock a drone launches itself
at the rocky. The machine rocks back from the blow, brings its heavy
manipulators up and slams the drone into the ground. He dragged the
drone away from the airlock, kicking and thrashing. Pinning it to the
ground, he puts a single ten mil armor piercing round through its head,
it's green blood splashes the ground and sizzles. I had to give Jeremy
credit for the brutal efficiency of it. We'd had two weeks of slogging
through drones. Dozens of times they'd leapt on the Rockies. While the
commander and the tech had jumped we hadn't. Just another horrifying
day at the office. Laughing he zoomed into the shoulder of the drone,
an ugly gash from below the neck to the armpit. "God Damn! That's the
work of a vibrablade!" The commander grinned. His marines had put up a
fight. Climbing into the MCM, it's a scene. Two dead marines lay on the
module floor one of them holding a shattered vibrablade. The other slashed
across the chest. Jeremy plugs into the general quarters system. "This
is private Hopkins. The xeno has been dealt with." "Hopkins? Jesus I'm
glad to hear your voice" comes a reply. At this the armored door to the
armory opened. A half dozen fully kitted marines tumbled out to see the
rocky and stop. "Ah fuck Henderson and Alverez really did it!" one of them
say. "Wrestled a fucking xeno to the ground and nearly took its head off
with a viroblade!" The marines stood around their fallen comrades. "A
hero's death." says another. At once they beat their chests and said
"Hoo-Rah." "What happened?" asks Jeremy. They all turn their attention
back to the rocky. "Fucking thing came out of the access panel and landed
on Alverez. When we lost contact with everybody, we kitted up. Henderson
slammed the door and as the doors shut he yelled he was going to "take
care of it" drawing his vibrablade. Then we lost gravity and started
tumbling. We strapped in and watched the external monitors. The Xeno beat
against the door but a ten mil would pop us like a balloon. We held on
and planned on popping the door and shredding the fucker when you showed
up." replied a marine whose name plate read Fisher. "Corporeal Fisher,
Welcome to the Asheron. I'd advise you get to a terminal and get the
point defenses up and running." Nodding another marine immediately got
to a terminal. "Apparently there's some scientists here who had some
control over the xeno's and that's all gone to hell. They're hold up in
some compound fifty clicks from here. Hurgs is heading over to their other
research base or something." Fisher nodded. "Glad to have your rocky and
the extra firepower." Jeremy replies. "Roger that. With Edgar acting
up, this unit won't be going anywhere soon. To this Fisher perks up,
"What the fuck happened?" "Dunno. Something to do with these scientists,
it triggered some failsafe. I don't know anymore." replies Jeremy. A
marine comes up to Fisher, "Sir, I've got the point defenses on line,
but the weather is playing hell with the system. I'm seeing movement five
hundred meters out, but I can't make much of it." At this Jeremy backs his
Rocky out of the unit and they close the airlocks. The two marines in body
bags have been placed under the MCM. "Sir, I'm going to launch a drone
to get a better vantage point." "Sounds good. We're pretty blind up here
without Edgar." I reply. Jeremy launches the drone. Quickly Alice starts
integrating the input. The MCM has landed among at least eight nests,
the nearest is about a hundred and fifty meters away. Jeremy jokes over
the channel, "Picked the right side to land on!" We all nod. He could
have easily bingoed right on a nest opening. One rocky is pretty badass,
but on flat ground against an unknown number of drones, it's at best a
delaying action. Roxxie joins into the channel. "Sir, I've managed to
opened the door to the main habitat spar, you'll want to see this." On
the monitors, the feet of a marine are seen sticking out of a vent,
frozen blood has pooled around the ankles. Another marine is on the
floor his helmet and face mask a shattered ruin. Past this the entire
corridor has been plastered with the alien resin. "Looks like they were
ambushed." Roxxie smashes her way through the resin to find two drones
crouching in the hallway and behind them the controller xeno. It's
brief and bloody. Roxxie obliterates all three in moments. The blood
splashes against the corridor walls and begins to eat into them. "I
was afraid of that." she says. Alice pipes up, "Structural integrity
warnings from habitat spar two grid section 43." We all nod. Three xenos
worth of blood can do plenty of damage. "Alice, how serious is this?" I
ask. "Full extent of damage unknown. Gladiator ships are build with a
high level of redundancy." I'd worked with Alice long enough to read
between the lines. Shit was broken, but the AI was too cagey to say
things were dire outright. "Rocky one is now five hundred meters from
the entrance to the beta site." I head back into the pit and this time I
do a clean jack in. Seeing the weather on the screen and experiencing it
through the neural jack are two different things. Heat lightning crackles
across the sky and rain lashes the rocky. At least I didn't have to worry
about waste heat. The trash can sized nuclear reactor at the core of my
rocky was pumping out serious amounts of power. Under some circumstances
cooling such a thing would be a problem. I checked the power levels and
was pleased to see that even over two weeks of daily use, the reactor had
only used a couple percentage of its fuel. I wondered what fresh hell I
was descending into. I was now a hundred and seventy five meters out. I
stopped the sled and contemplated my options. I was a single rocky, I
needed to play this smart. "Alice, launch a drone to give me over watch
and send one down the tunnel to see what I'm up against." Immediately
drones took off from the sled. I rode shotgun as Alice dove the little
saucer shaped ariel vehicle down into the opening. Into the center
chamber I could see that the durasteel door like in the alpha site was
ajar, peeled from the wall on one side. They couldn't go through it, so
they simply went around it. The drone spun in the center of the chamber
sending lidar pulses down the tunnels that radiated out. No movement,
but we knew better. In a moments notice xenos could come out of every damn
crevice. Alice moved the drone through the doors. The rough surfaces gave
way to gleaming labs. On emergency power and with smashed lights an eerie
flicker of yellow filled the labs. The scene was grizzly. Blood streaked
the walls. Cages were broken open, lab equipment was smashed. There was a
level of violence here that shocked me. Freezers were ripped open, their
shelves and vials scattered. This was beyond the base xeno need to find
vessels to reproduce, this was hate filled. The drone flew on, the horrors
growing. Robinson had been right, Ziegler had been a busy man. Alice
stops in front of a stasis tube, the upper half of an armless drone
floats in the water, electrodes bristle from it's elongated head. Alice
flies on. Laying dead in a hospital bed is girl, clearly a hybrid of
human and xeno XNA/DNA. Her angelic face is contrasted against her bio
mechanical head wearing a crown of electrodes. Her chest is slashed
open. The gleam of bio mechanical anatomy and petite human features are
intermixed in a vaguely elegant way. Janice gasps "What in the unholy
christ has this madman been doing?" she whispers. Robinson just snickers,
"What he always dreamed to do. Get far away from anyone who would ask any
questions and play god." I agree with him on this. The drone flies down a
couple tunnels but finds nothing. This site is a tomb. I bring the radio
up to full power. "Hurgs here, calling Zigler." "Zielger here. What's the
status of the Beta site?" he asks. "Destroyed" I reply. Over the link I
hear a heavy sigh. "In the lab there was a very special creature." "It is
dead." I reply. "It was a she and her name was Eliana." he replies flatly
over the link. Clearly I'd touched a nerve so I backed off a bit. "I
didn't find any survivors. The lab had been wrecked." I replied. "Any
status on the main habitat?" he asks. "We've got people fifty clicks out
and we're formulating a plan." I reply. "Well, formulate faster. If what
I'm being told is correct, there's a large assault being planned." he
replied. Janice whispered in my ear, "How can he know that?" I replied
off channel, "He's got more of these hybrids, it must be his link to the
controller xeno's." "Please define large scale." I replied. "That I don't
know. But I can easily guess, hundreds? I also think the controllers
have made some deal with the queens." Just fucking wonderful.. the
millipede worth of shoes kept dropping. "Ziegler, when were you going to
let us in on this?" I asked. "I'm learning this now I promise. Please
get your troops to the main habitat." Alice now whispered in my ear,
"Based on vocal strain, this person is under extreme stress." Thanks
Alice. I appreciated the analysis and it confirmed my fears. "Is the
Alpha site still intact?" I ask. "Barely. They've been pounding and
scratching around the door for an hour, but don't seem to be making much
headway. "They undermined the door in the beta facility, if these things
are even smarter than we thought, it won't be long until they go for that
tactic as well." I reply. "Shit. I know I just sent you to the beta site,
but I think I'm in trouble here." he replies. I sense the sled shifting
under my feet. "I can be there in twenty minutes." Alice points out that
she can probably push it and do it in less. I agree with the AI, now that
the track has been made it's not worried about flipping the sled. She
wasn't kidding. The AI is pouring on the speed. Even in the driving rain,
the sled is easily doing seventy. I see the steam coming up from the sled,
as its reactor is busy working at max power. I ask Alice to keep me posted
and keep the drones flying. Janice pings me to head to the conference
room, I eject. I wander in to some seriously long faces. "What's up?" I
ask. Roxxie is sitting at the table. "I finally found the other xeno." she
replies. "That's good?" I ask. "Yes, and no. That fucker is dead, but
not before they managed to tear into a good chunk of our food, broke a
bunch of stuff in the muster module and then made its way down to the
engine module and tried and thankfully failed to do any damage. "Any
thing about Edgar?" I asked. Ruvi shrugged. "Still doing whatever its
crazy cyber brain is doing. The CIC module is still intact, and the
xeno's are all dead so we should be able to get in there and at least
disconnect him if not more." Janice laughed at this. "There's also the
damage that was done to the habitat spar. I'd run some calculations
and it's going to be real dodgy getting up to luminal speed with that
spar." I trusted Janice in this regard, she'd started as an engineer
before getting recruited into the program. I turned to Robinson, "Think
you can persuade some marines to go unplug a crazy computer?" He nods and
gets on the tether and explains what he wants them to do. Quickly Marines
make their way to the CIC. Edgar is isolated from the DeBe. Hatches are
closed, sections are re-pressurized. Finally we start to get a handle
on the ship. Getting home without Edgar is going to be complicated, but
that's a bridge we'll burn when we get there. Robinson makes a show of
it returning to the CIC like a triumphant hero.
